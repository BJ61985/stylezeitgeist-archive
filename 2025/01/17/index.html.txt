AT PITTI UOMO SETCHU ASKS MORE OF US BY ASKING LESS

   Fashion, Features/Op-EdBy Eugene RabkinJan 17, 2025

   "We are not a fashion company," said Satoshi Kuwata, the designer of
   SETCHU, emphatically, after showing a foldable origami blazer he
   developed with Davies & Son, the oldest Saville Row tailor. We were at
   the press preview for his show at Pitti Uomo, the premier men's trade
   show in Florence. It was the first SETCHU show, and, according to
   Kuwata, most likely its last; the reason being that Kuwata's clothes
   require careful examination, not to say contemplation.
