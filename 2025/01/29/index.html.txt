MEN'S FALL / WINTER 2025 PARIS FASHION WEEK REPORT

   Fashion, Features/Op-EdBy Eugene RabkinJan 29, 2025

   This January Paris greeted us with rain and more rain. In the seven
   days I saw sun only once - proof that god hates fashion. The weather
   put a damper on a season that was already decidedly mid. If fashion is
   supposed to reflect our culture, what it tells us is that our culture
   is mired in mediocrity. Note that I did not say that it was an awful
   season, nor am I particularly disappointed, which means that I got
   exactly what I expected - mids. Pretty much all the editors I've spoken
   with this season did not expect much either. We've capitulated to
   fashion in the say way the American left has capitulated to Trump. We
   shrug our shoulders because we know what to expect. We troop from one
   show to another without much joy and without much anticipation. We are
   tired; what was once fun is starting to look an awful lot like work.
