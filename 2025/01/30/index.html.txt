PARIS MENS FALL / WINTER 2025 SHOWROOM REPORT

   Fashion, Features/Op-EdBy Eugene RabkinJan 30, 2025

   Last year I promised to lean into supporting smaller brands, and I have
   valiantly tried to visit as many showrooms as possible, so much so that
   I have not seen much of Paris this time. Each season I receive an
   avalanche of invitations, but I am just one person, so I am taking an
   opportunity to offer my apologies to those I was not able to visit. In
   general, many of the brands I've seen have stuck to their guns. This is
   fine, but it also does not provide much food for thought. Quite a few
   are struggling, but I hope that now that the so-called luxury is in
   tailspin, it's their time to come in and offer a superior product at a
   better price. There is certainly a contingent of men and women ready
   for it. And I see it as my job to connect these brands with a new
   audience. So, here it is.
