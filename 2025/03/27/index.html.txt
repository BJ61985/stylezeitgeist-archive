What Karl Marx Can Teach Us About the Current State of Fashion

   Fashion, Features/Op-EdBy Eugene RabkinMar 27, 2025

   There's something rotten in the state of fashion. The kingdom of dreams
   seems to no longer be capable of producing them. Instead it has swamped
   its subjects in the sea of overpriced premium mediocre stuff, causing
   fatigue and boredom. What does an umpteenth collab or a logoed tee mean
   today? Nothing.

   But what does Marx's theory have to do with fashion? It helps to unpack
   one of central concepts of Das Kapital, exchange value versus use
   value. Marx's basic position is this: in the pre-capitalist economy,
   most things, including clothing, were produced by highly skilled
   artisans who were capable of crafting an object, let's say a coat, from
   start to finish, and were also likely to sell the product of their
   labor directly; which means that they fully identified with their labor
   and were invested into everything they made. By nature of their
   production, they could not make very much, and many things they made
   was quite expensive, which in turn limited the consumer's purchasing
   power. And so when the consumer did acquire an object, say the
   aforementioned coat, they would value it for its essential properties,
   such as protecting him from the elements, keeping him warm, and making
   him look presentable. Marx called this use value, the stuff that gave a
   coat its coatness, making that object real and concrete.
