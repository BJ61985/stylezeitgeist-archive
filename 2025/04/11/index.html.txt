Trump, the Unwitting Sustainability Warrior

   FashionBy Eugene RabkinApr 11, 2025

   Take a deep breath, and suspend your justified knee-jerk reaction at
   mentioning Trump before you read on, as I had to do in order to write
   this article.

   There is much debate about the economic damage of Trump's harsh tariff
   policies. Even though most tariffs have been suspended for 90 days,
   let's go ahead with the scenario in which they go into effect. Many
   outcomes are still hazy, but one thing is clear, they will likely
   decrease consumption, especially in America. And in the world of
   overconsumption, isn't that what so many of us who are concerned with
   sustainability want? The developed world, and the US especially, groans
   under the weight of cheap stuff that the current world economy,
   especially in Asia, overproduces, and that ends up in landfills. The
   cycle of planned obsolescence has sped up across the board, but
   especially in fashion, where we no longer talk about fast fashion from
   the likes of H&M, but about ultra-fast-fashion from the likes of the
   Chinese giant Shein.
