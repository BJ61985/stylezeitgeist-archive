Duran Lantink's Appointment to Gaultier Proves That Contemporary Fashion Is a
Simulation

   FashionBy Eugene RabkinApr 15, 2025

   Today we woke up to the news that the up and coming designer Duran
   Lantink was appointed as the creative director of Jean Paul Gaultier.
   This completes his recent victory lap that began with sweeping a
   handful of fashion prizes, including the Andam award and the LVMH
   prize.

   And while it is commendable that a young designer gets a crack at
   spearheading one of the most important brands in the history of
   contemporary fashion, it's also worth taking a fresh look at what he
   actually makes. The artifacts that can be called garments in his oeuvre
   are pretty forgettable - there is no innovation there in terms of the
   silhouette, nor is there a strong discerning aesthetic statement.
   Lantink's true strength lies in making outlandish, sculpted outfits
   that look good on Instagram. The look from his last collection that was
   shared the most was not a garment at all, but a sculpted male bust,
   worn on a female model. Things like this are designed to go viral in
   that look-at-this-silly-thing way. They are fashion as memes.
