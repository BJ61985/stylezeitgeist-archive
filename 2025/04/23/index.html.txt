Unpacking Kering's Earnings

   FashionBy Eugene RabkinApr 23, 2025

   Today, Kering, the luxury conglomerate that owns Gucci, Yves Saint
   Laurent, Balenciaga, and Bottega Veneta, among others, reported its
   first quarter earnings, and the picture of the luxury industry it
   paints is even more dire than many thought. Overall sales are down by
   14%, Gucci's sales for the first three months of 2025 are down by 25%,
   as Kering's biggest brand flounders in the wake of a creative director
   reshuffling. At Yves Saint Laurent, its second biggest brand, sales are
   down 9%. Frustratingly, Kering does not break out Balenciaga's
   earnings, as it lumps them into "Other Houses," which include McQueen,
   Brioni, and a handful of jewelry brands they own. But Kering dropped a
   couple of hints in its earnings report.

   1976 called punk indelibly changed the trajectory of nightclubbing
   forever. For about eighteen months, sartorial individuality reigned for
   those initial participants. Although Westwood and McLaren's SEX and
   Seditionaires boutique provided expensive garments infused with the
   spikily subversiveness forever associated with punk, DIY styling rose
   like a rocket within those months with a slew of customization ideas
   utilized to express disaffection, nihilism and sexual deviation.
