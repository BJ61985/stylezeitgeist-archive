Superfine: Tailoring Black Style at the Met Museum in New York

   FashionBy Karlo SteelMay 9, 2025

   Superfine, an exhibition on Black dandyism which opens this Saturday at
   The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, presents a history of Black
   style through the lense of dandyism, emphasizing the importance of
   sartorial style to Black identity formation in the Atlantic diaspora
   and the ways Black designers have interpreted and reimaged this
   history. The exhibition aims to highlight the various styles one could
   employ in order to be identified as a dandy: from austere minimalism to
   hyper-colorful tailoring, from deconstructed denim to high tech
   sportswear, dispelling the stereotype of flamboyance being the only
   indicator of dandyism.
