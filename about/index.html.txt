About / Policies

   ABOUT:
   I came to fashion through music. As a teenager, I learned through
   watching music videos that what my favorite musicians wore went
   together with their sounds and words. For the first time it clicked in
   me that clothing can be a medium of expression. I began being attracted
   to fashion designers, such as Ann Demeulemeester, Raf Simons, and
   Undercover, who clearly thought the same. I started StyleZeitgeist in
   2006 in order to find like-minded people, and I've found many.

   Over the years StyleZeitgeist became a destination for individuals who
   are passionate about fashion design and its relationship with the rest
   of culture. We aim to cut through the noise and hype that surrounds
   much of fashion today. If fashion is culture, StyleZeitgeist is
   counterculture.
   -- Eugene Rabkin, founder.
