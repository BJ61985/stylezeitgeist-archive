   StyleZeitgeist Academy is an independent education platform that offers
   courses for fashion enthusiasts, students, and professionals who want
   to study fashion at an academic level, in a structured yet engaging
   way, free from institutional bureaucracy and social-media chaos.

   Our courses provide a comprehensive overview of how contemporary
   fashion evolved, its key players, trends, cultural movements, and major
   sociopolitical events: through a mix of history and theory, students
   will learn not only what has happened in fashion industry, but discuss
   why it happened and how.

   The academy was founded by Eugene Rabkin, a former professor at Parsons
   the New School for Design, and an industry-recognized thought leader
   with fifteen years of writing experience. The idea for the academy
   arose from numerous conversations with fashion students and enthusiasts
   who have voiced the same complaint, that there is a lack of
   comprehensive framework for learning about fashion.

   Our courses are taught remotely to accommodate a global student body.
   The schedule is designed for full time students and employees. Each
   course is supported by a comprehensive online learning suite that
   contains all course materials, including books, articles, video, and
   audio.

   We keep our tuition fees on a manageable level by being laser-focused
   on education. StyleZeitgeist Academy does not issue diplomas -- we
   offer knowledge. Our goal is to build an informed discourse about
   fashion by continuously adding courses and faculty.

FAQ


   What is the format of your courses?

   The courses are taught via Zoom. A typical session consists of an
   hour-long lecture, assisted by a visual presentation, followed by a
   seminar, where students and instructor discuss the material. Some are
   semester-long, college-level courses. Others will be structured as
   shorter, master-class level courses. You will need a camera-equipped
   device, as we ask all students to be on camera to facilitate both
   lecture and discussion. Each class is supported by the Notion app,
   where each course is organized by sessions, with all supporting
   materials. We also run a Slack channel for additional discussion
   in-between classes.


   Are there prerequisites for taking a course?

   There are no academic prerequisites for taking our courses. We design
   them for people of various levels of education. Although we will
   sometimes tackle serious theory, it will be done in a guided manner. In
   the past we have had everyone from high school graduates to Ph.Ds in
   our courses. The only requirement is a fair understanding of spoken and
   written English (though you are free to read assigned books in your
   preferred language).


   What time zone are your courses in?

   Courses are often taught on weekends for fall and spring semester (more
   intensive in the summer semester) and begin at 12 p.m. EST (New York
   City) in order to accommodate the widest possible array of
   international students, from West Coast to continental Europe. If you
   live in Asia but are dedicated to learning, we welcome all night owls.


   What happens if I miss a session?

   A video recording of each lecture will be made available to you. The
   seminar parts are not recorded to protect student privacy. Please note,
   that although we've had students go through a semester solely relying
   on recordings due to a conflict in their schedule, we encourage
   everyone to be present for the discussion part.


   Do we get homework?

   There is reading homework for each class, as well as videos,
   documentaries, and podcast episodes. There is no written homework and
   no grading. Those who are interested in tutoring or mentoring can sign
   up for the Advanced study version of each class.


   What is advanced study?

   Advanced study offers you four one-on-one sessions with instructors,
   including further help with the course, consulting on personal and
   creative projects, writing and editing guidance, and brainstorming.


   Do you offer college credits?

   At this time we do not offer college credits or certificates.


   How can I pay tuition?

   We accept bank transfer or PayPal. Payments via PayPal are subject to a
   3% surcharge in order to recoup PayPal fees.
