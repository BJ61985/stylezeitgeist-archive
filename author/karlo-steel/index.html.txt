Superfine: Tailoring Black Style at the Met Museum in New York

   FashionBy Karlo SteelMay 9, 2025

   Superfine, an exhibition on Black dandyism which opens this Saturday at
   The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, presents a history of Black
   style through the lense of dandyism, emphasizing the importance of
   sartorial style to Black identity formation in the Atlantic diaspora
   and the ways Black designers have interpreted and reimaged this
   history. The exhibition aims to highlight the various styles one could
   employ in order to be identified as a dandy: from austere minimalism to
   hyper-colorful tailoring, from deconstructed denim to high tech
   sportswear, dispelling the stereotype of flamboyance being the only
   indicator of dandyism.

OUTLAWS: Fashion Renegades Of Leigh Bowery's 1980s London

   FashionBy Karlo SteelApr 23, 2025

   That burst of angry, youthful energy unleashed on London streets in
   1976 called punk indelibly changed the trajectory of nightclubbing
   forever. For about eighteen months, sartorial individuality reigned for
   those initial participants. Although Westwood and McLaren's SEX and
   Seditionaires boutique provided expensive garments infused with the
   spikily subversiveness forever associated with punk, DIY styling rose
   like a rocket within those months with a slew of customization ideas
   utilized to express disaffection, nihilism and sexual deviation.

Calder: Sculpting Time

   CultureBy Karlo SteelDec 11, 2024

   The introduction of movement into sculpture. That implausible leap from
   the static to the temporal. Alexander Calder, the inventor of the
   mobile, achieved what the great Hellenistic sculptors could only
   suggest in the windblown robe and fluttering wings of Nike of
   Samothrace. He broke the mold. Jean Paul Sartre described Calder's
   mobiles as "mid-way between matter and life". They are a composition of
   motions, a series of fleeting moments where balance, force and tension
   coexist in perfect harmony. Calder: Sculpting Time (published by
   Silvana Editorial, $50.00) covers MASILugano's ambitious exhibition in
   168 pages, highlighting his most prolific era, the 1930s to 1960s.

Book Review: Madame Grès Couture Paris

   FashionBy Karlo SteelNov 1, 2024

   Madame Grès Couture Paris, recently published by Rizzoli, is the latest
   book by fashion historian and curator Olivier Saillard. Saillard, whose
   extensive accomplishments at Paris' Palais Galleria are credited with
   invigorating an interest in fashion beyond that of the more established
   Musée des Arts Décoratifs, is one of the leading voices on the work of
   Madame Grès. His recent "Alaïa / Grès" exhibition at the Alaïa
   Fondation, and "Madame Grès, The Art Of Draping" at SCAD last year,
   continues to further the legacy of one of the most innovative
   couturiers in the history of fashion.

   CultureBy Karlo SteelOct 15, 2024
