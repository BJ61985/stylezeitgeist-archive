The StyleZeitgeist Guide to Antwerp : 2025 Edition

   Features/Op-Ed, TravelBy Eugene RabkinFeb 20, 2025Leave a comment

   It is hard to believe that we have not updated our Antwerp guide since
   2013, what with it being one of my favorite cities in Europe. What
   keeps pulling me back to this city, besides professional obligations?
   Fashion, obviously, as well as a mix of medieval and contemporary
   architecture, with some Art Nouveau buildings thrown...

The StyleZeitgeist Guide to Paris: 2025 Edition

   Features/Op-Ed, TravelBy Eugene RabkinFeb 13, 2025

   On some level writing a guide to Paris is an exercise in futility. What
   can one write about a city where you can get a good glass of wine and a
   decent meal in so many places - as long as you stay away from the
   touristy areas - and where there is no such thing as the best bakery,
   since you can only get bread that is either fine or excellent.
   Therefore, this guide to Paris is the guide to what I have gotten to
   know over the years of traveling to the City of Light.

   I've been to Paris about fifty times, I've walked it back and forth,
   and I know I am not nearly close to discovering all the good things it
   has to offer and have not sufficiently explored all of its
   neighborhoods (for example, I rarely find myself in Montmartre, or in
   Charonne, and some day I'd like to eat my way through rue des Martyrs).
   I've not been to the 20th arrondissement, which is where the epicenter
   of hipsterdom has moved to. I have not yet been to the Catacombs (very
   ungoth of me), and I've never had any luck record shopping in Paris. So
   this guide is flawed and deeply personal, and I am all ears if you want
   to add to it.

The StyleZeitgeist Tokyo Guide: 2025 Edition

   Culture, TravelBy Eugene RabkinFeb 6, 2025

   For the aesthetically inclined and designed conscious there is probably
   no better place on earth than Tokyo. And for science fiction fans it's
   probably the closest thing to encountering another humanoid
   civilization - things are similar enough and foreign enough in Tokyo to
   make it all the more exciting, even though in the last couple of years
   the intractable march of globalization of culture has left an indelible
   stamp on the city. I've been to Tokyo three times and by now feel
   confident enough to write a guide of sorts. Because there is so much to
   do and see here, I decided that the best approach is to break it down
   by neighborhood rather than the list of places, because there are too
   many of them. Tokyo is vast - don't even think about spending less than
   a week here. I'll list the neighborhoods more or less in order of
   preference or proximity to each other. Aside from these
   recommendations, the best advice I can give you is to get lost in the
   wonderful maze of Tokyo's streets - because the best spots are often in
   the back alleys off the main thoroughfares. You'll need your GPS.

The StyleZeitgeist Guide to Kyoto: 2025 Edition

   Features/Op-Ed, TravelBy Eugene RabkinJan 16, 2025

   To say that Kyoto is a magical city is like saying that Francis Bacon
   is a great artist - neither words nor pictures can relate the firsthand
   experience. The feeling of peace that washes over you as you stroll the
   zen gardens or feel the wooden floors of Buddhist temples creak under
   your unshod feet. Even the hordes of tourists cannot spoil the
   experience if you are in the right mindset. There is no season when
   Kyoto is not full of visitors, or at least I have not experienced it.
   There are ways to avoid them somewhat by visiting the smaller temples,
   but no way to avoid them by visiting the bigger ones, but visit them
   you must, at least on your first trip. But you would also be missing
   out if you viewed Kyoto as just a temple destination; exploring its
   rich fabric of shops, restaurants, and a maze of architecture is a joy
   in itself. If you want to do it right, you'd probably need a week or
   so.

The StyleZeitgeist Guide to London: 2024 Edition

   TravelBy Eugene RabkinOct 22, 2024

   In any other year I would probably be in London today. Think of this
   guide as an exercise in catharsis, and not only for me. Perhaps you'll
   read it and it will inspire you to visit London whenever you can travel
   again.

StyleZeitgeist Japan Guide to New York City

   Features/Op-Ed, TravelBy Eugene RabkinDec 4, 2020

   Japan is my favorite place to travel to. I cannot do this now, but I
   can still visit all the Japanese or Japan-inspired places in New York.
