Dolce & Gabbana at Grand Palais, Paris

   By Eugene Rabkin Culture, Fashion Jan 31, 2025

   When future historians will examine the list of crimes against humanity
   of our time, the work of Dolce & Gabbana will feature prominently, or,
   as they say in fashion, boldly. The current exhibition of the dismal
   duo's oeuvre at Grand Palais in Paris drives this point home with such
   ferocious force as to make one's eyes bleed from all the ludicrous
   pomposity on display. Mistitled Du Coeur a la Main, it should have been
   called The Kingdom of Kitsch, because that's what Domenico Dolce and
   Stefano Gabbana have built, both at their brand and with this show at
   one of the world's most venerable museums, whose stones are undoubtedly
   groaning with shame at having been burdened with so much bad taste.

   The shame of Grand Palais is evident in the fact that the exhibit is
   held off to the side of the palace, and at its start features a
   decidedly unglamorous staircase that makes one wonder why we must enter
   through the servant quarters to get to the main rooms. Once inside,
   however, you'll be wishing for the unadorned simplicity of the
   staircase, because adornment is all you'll be seeing for the rest of
   your journey through the nine circles of fashion hell befitting Dante's
   worst nightmares. You will see gold. You will see lots of gold. You
   will see so much gold that your brain will think that gold is all there
   is. You will be vomiting gold by the end.

   The show is held on two floors and is broken down into various rooms
   with different themes. But there is a unifying element to the exhibit,
   sartorial kitsch. Because Dolce & Gabbana have been turning out kitsch
   for the last thirty years, we have forgotten how elegant their
   beginnings were in the late `80s and the early `90s. What happened
   after that is anybody's guess - maybe they saw Gianni Versace's
   success, or maybe they were simultaneously struck by lightning. It is
   entirely possible that some people think that what D&G produce is High
   Camp, a la Gaultier (or even Versace for that matter). Let this
   reviewer disabuse you of this notion. For the work of Dolce & Gabbana
   is heavy with self-importance and utterly humorless. The exhibition
   serves, if it serves any purpose at all besides being a major
   advertising vehicle for the brand, as a testament to that.

   But, to the details. The exhibition starts with a series of highly
   ornamental ensembles meant to evoke Italian art heritage, particularly
   the Renaissance. There are jackets heavily embroidered with images of
   famous Italian paintings, including Portrait of a Musician by Leonardo
   Da Vinci, which I happened to see by chance ten days before at
   Pinacoteca Ambrosiana in Milan. (I prefer the painting.)

   Aligning with Italian cultural heritage has been one of D&G's calling
   cards. Undoubtedly they see themselves as part of the great Italian
   cultural lineage, which was evidenced by the amazing Leonardo Da Vinci
   clock that they restored and donated to the Pinanoteca, but only after
   slapping their logo on it. Here it must be said that just because Dolce
   and Gabbana are Italian does not guarantee that that they are heirs to
   Da Vinci any more than Fedez is an heir to Vivaldi. Speaking of which,
   in this atrocity exhibition the pair also tries to latch on to Italian
   opera and classical music. Whom are they kidding? We all know that in
   reality they listen to Dua Lipa as background noise while FaceTiming
   with Kourtney Kardashian, so she can order a dress embroidered with
   "G.PUCCINI, MADAMA BUTTERFLY" on it, even though she wouldn't know
   Puccini from a cappuccino.

   But I fear I am running ahead of myself, because before you get to the
   opera room you must pass through various other circles of visual hell.
   One of these features a Byzantine Christian theme weirdly combined with
   the Roman and the Greek, as evidenced in a mannequin of a legionnaire
   who holds Zeus' thunderbolts in one hand against a backdrop of a golden
   icon. Not that one expects historical accuracy from Dolce & Gabbana -
   the point is that the art of the Byzantine empire had gold and jewels
   and gold and jewels are really what D&G are after. And Jesus, do they
   deliver on that front. I am confident that this exhibition caused a
   worldwide shortage of gemstones and golden thread, which in turn
   undoubtedly contributed to global inflation. There were gemstones on
   everything and everything with gemstones. And not just the clothes. The
   shoes - dear lord - THE SHOES! There were golden slippers with gems,
   velvet slippers with pearls, golden and velvet slippers with gems and
   pearls. It was unmerciful, which is, by the way, un-Christian.

   But back to Italy. Did you know that Domenico Dolce is from Sicily and
   the pair is inspired by the beautiful island? You didn't?! Don't worry,
   there is a room for that too, one where folklore turns into kitsch
   through visual overload. The floors and the walls of this room are
   covered in colorful Sicilian tiles featuring cocks and feathers and
   happy peasant women. Only the ceiling is left untouched - a missed
   opportunity. On display in this apoplectically colorful room are videos
   showing the wonderful Sicilian craftsmen debasing themselves for
   Domenico and Stefano's pleasure, as well as some highly feathered
   ensembles. And if the clothes are not enough, there are also Dolce &
   Gabbana x Bialetti stovetop coffee makers on display, which you can now
   - wink, wink - purchase in stores.

   Are you not entertained?! Then proceed to another room, this one
   highlighting D&G's tailoring skills. You will see half-finished
   jackets, tailored shirt collars, videos of impeccable handwork. So much
   savoir faire to serve so much bad taste, alas.

   The exhibit loops around like a gaudy Mobius strip, and by the time you
   are out it all feels like one seizure-inducing blur. If the curators
   had mercy on their audience, the show would end with an entirely black
   room, so the visitors can decompress. And there are visitors aplenty -
   it was crowded and most time slots that were not on a Monday were sold
   out. Perhaps this show will beat some kind of an attendance record. And
   there is one record it will hold beyond a shadow of a doubt, for no
   museum has ever seen so much gaudiness per square foot.
