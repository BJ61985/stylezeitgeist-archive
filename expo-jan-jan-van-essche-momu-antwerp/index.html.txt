   "Khayal" is an intimate exhibit of the Antwerp designer Jan-Jan Van
   Essche, currently on display at MoMu, the city's fashion museum. The
   installation takes over the ground floor space of the museum. It begins
   with Van Essche's calligraphy-based drawings that guide you into just
   one room, where the designer has created an installation highlighting
   ten key silhouettes that embody his work. The space unfolds gradually
   as you walk around a wooden construction resembling traditional
   Japanese architecture, with custom made mannequins that reflect the
   designer's earthy West-meets-East approach. The serenity of the space
   gradually takes over, reflecting the serenity of Van Essche's designs
   as reflected in the handmade natural fabrics, indigo dyes, and loose
   silhouettes. Van Essche has created his own world, conducive to
   contemplation and slowing down time, and by the end of your visit the
   world outside will fall away.
