   https://www.stylezeitgeist.com/?p=65673 <p>Superfine, an exhibition on
   Black dandyism which opens this Saturday at The Metropolitan Museum of
   Art in New York, presents a history of Black style through the lense of
   dandyism, emphasizing the importance of sartorial style to Black
   identity formation in the Atlantic diaspora and the ways Black
   designers have interpreted and reimaged this history. The exhibition
   aims to highlight the various styles one could employ in order to be
   identified as a dandy: from austere minimalism to hyper-colorful
   tailoring, from deconstructed denim to high tech sportswear, dispelling
   the stereotype of flamboyance being the only indicator of dandyism.</p>

   https://www.stylezeitgeist.com/?p=65658 <p>Today, Kering, the luxury
   conglomerate that owns Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent, Balenciaga, and
   Bottega Veneta, among others, reported its first quarter earnings, and
   the picture of the luxury industry it paints is even more dire than
   many thought. Overall sales are down by 14%, Gucci‚s sales for the
   first three months of 2025 are down by 25%, as Kering‚s biggest brand
   flounders in the wake of a creative director reshuffling. At Yves Saint
   Laurent, its second biggest brand, sales are down 9%. Frustratingly,
   Kering does not break out Balenciaga‚s earnings, as it lumps them into
   ‚Other Houses,‚ which include McQueen, Brioni, and a handful of jewelry
   brands they own. But Kering dropped a couple of hints in its earnings
   report.</p> <p>The post <a

   https://www.stylezeitgeist.com/?p=65646 <p>That burst of angry,
   youthful energy unleashed on London streets in 1976 called punk
   indelibly changed the trajectory of nightclubbing forever. For about
   eighteen months, sartorial individuality reigned for those initial
   participants. Although Westwood and McLaren‚s SEX and Seditionaires
   boutique provided expensive garments infused with the spikily
   subversiveness forever associated with punk, DIY styling rose like a
   rocket within those months with a slew of customization ideas utilized
   to express disaffection, nihilism and sexual deviation.</p> <p>The post

   we woke up to the news that the up and coming designer Duran Lantink
   was appointed as the creative director of Jean Paul Gaultier. This
   completes his recent victory lap that began with sweeping a handful of
   fashion prizes, including the Andam award and the LVMH prize.</p>
   <p>And while it is commendable that a young designer gets a crack at
   spearheading one of the most important brands in the history of
   contemporary fashion, it‚s also worth taking a fresh look at what he
   actually makes. The artifacts that can be called garments in his oeuvre
   are pretty forgettable ‚ there is no innovation there in terms of the
   silhouette, nor is there a strong discerning aesthetic statement.
   Lantink‚s true strength lies in making outlandish, sculpted outfits
   that look good on Instagram. The look from his last collection that was
   shared the most was not a garment at all, but a sculpted male bust,
   worn on a female model. Things like this are designed to go viral in
   that look-at-this-silly-thing way. They are fashion as memes.</p>

   Fashion https://www.stylezeitgeist.com/?p=65618 <p>Take a deep breath,
   and suspend your justified knee-jerk reaction at mentioning Trump
   before you read on, as I had to do in order to write this article.</p>
   <p>There is much debate about the economic damage of Trump's harsh
   tariff policies. Even though most tariffs have been suspended for 90
   days, let's go ahead with the scenario in which they go into effect.
   Many outcomes are still hazy, but one thing is clear, they will likely
   decrease consumption, especially in America. And in the world of
   overconsumption, isn't that what so many of us who are concerned with
   sustainability want? The developed world, and the US especially, groans
   under the weight of cheap stuff that the current world economy,
   especially in Asia, overproduces, and that ends up in landfills. The
   cycle of planned obsolescence has sped up across the board, but
   especially in fashion, where we no longer talk about fast fashion from
   the likes of H&#038;M, but about ultra-fast-fashion from the likes of
   the Chinese giant Shein.</p> <p>The post <a

   https://www.stylezeitgeist.com/?p=65607 <p>There‚s something rotten in
   the state of fashion. The kingdom of dreams seems to no longer be
   capable of producing them. Instead it has swamped its subjects in the
   sea of overpriced premium mediocre stuff, causing fatigue and boredom.
   What does an umpteenth collab or a logoed tee mean today? Nothing.</p>
   <p>But what does Marx‚s theory have to do with fashion? It helps to
   unpack one of central concepts of Das Kapital, exchange value versus
   use value. Marx‚s basic position is this: in the pre-capitalist
   economy, most things, including clothing, were produced by highly
   skilled artisans who were capable of crafting an object, let‚s say a
   coat, from start to finish, and were also likely to sell the product of
   their labor directly; which means that they fully identified with their
   labor and were invested into everything they made. By nature of their
   production, they could not make very much, and many things they made
   was quite expensive, which in turn limited the consumer‚s purchasing
   power. And so when the consumer did acquire an object, say the
   aforementioned coat, they would value it for its essential properties,
   such as protecting him from the elements, keeping him warm, and making
   him look presentable. Marx called this use value, the stuff that gave a
   coat its coatness, making that object real and concrete.</p> <p>The
