History of Contemporary Fashion: 1947 - Present

          Coco Chanel, gelatin silver print, Richard Avedon | National
          Museum of American History; Christian Dior (right) with
          Alexander Liberman | Archives of American Art; Pierre Cardin by
          Eddie Adams for Time Magazine | National Portrait Gallery;
          Clothes by Miyake, photos by Irving Penn | Cooper Hewitt


   This college level, 15-session study will offer a comprehensive
   overview of the history of contemporary fashion, concentrating on the
   period from 1947 until now. From Dior's New Look, through the decline
   of haute couture and the rise of pret-a-porter, the life and death of
   the avant-garde, to today's conglomerate fashion, this course will
   examine how fashion has changed over the past 75 years, connecting a
   patchwork of designers, brands, and trends into a coherent narrative
   that will give the students a solid understanding of the contemporary
   fashion landscape.


   The full syllabus is available upon request by writing to
   info@sz-mag.com or by DMing @stylezeitgeist on Instagram.


   The course proceeds decade by decade, tying together disparate fashion
   movements and putting them into a wider cultural and theoretical
   context. From the haute couture of Christian Dior and Yves Saint
   Laurent, to the punk fashions of Malcolm McLaren and Vivenne Westwood,
   to the French camp revolutionaries Jean Paul Gaultier and Thierry
   Mugler, to the avant-garde of Comme des Garçons and Yohji Yamamoto, to
   the Antwerp Six and Martin Margiela, to the minimalists Helmut Lang and
   Jil Sander, to the British enfant terribles Alexander McQueen and John
   Galliano, to Rick Owens; these are just some of the names whose work we
   will closely examine. We will also examine the rise of menswear and
   streetwear, and the corporatization of fashion in the early 21st
   Century.


     * The course curriculum is modeled on a full semester worth of
       studying at a higher educational institution.
     * Each session will be a mix of lecture and seminar, meaning that the
       students will be encouraged to actively participate in discussions.
     * There will be assigned reading, but no written homework or a final
       project, unless you are willing to do one as part of the advanced
       study program.
     * For the Spring 2025 semester, the course is taught once a week, on
       Sundays from 12 p.m. to 2 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.
     * Schedule: February 2nd, 2025 - May 18th, 2025 (a spring break TBA)
     * Tuition: early bird $999 (register before January 20th, 2025) /
       regular tuition $1299 / advanced study $1499 (includes four
       personal consultations with the instructor)


   Please note that the course is limited to 20 students.
