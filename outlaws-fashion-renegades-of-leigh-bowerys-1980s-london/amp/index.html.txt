OUTLAWS: Fashion Renegades Of Leigh Bowery's 1980s London

   That burst of angry, youthful energy unleashed on London streets in
   1976 called punk indelibly changed the trajectory of nightclubbing
   forever. For about eighteen months, sartorial individuality reigned for
   those initial participants. Although Westwood and McLaren's SEX and
   Seditionaries boutique provided expensive garments infused with the
   spikily subversiveness forever associated with punk, DIY styling rose
   like a rocket within those months with a slew of customization ideas
   utilized to express disaffection, nihilism and sexual deviation.

   But it would not last. Punk quickly became a uniform (black leather
   jacket, choppy hair, etc.) and the promise of a fabulously
   individualistic future faded by 1978. One of the disappointed, the
   illustratively named Steve Strange, and his friend DJ Rusty Egan,
   decided to do something about it by starting a "Bowie Night", every
   Tuesday, at a tiny club in seedy Soho called Billy's in the autumn of
   that year.

   Billy's brought back the individuality craved by its denizens. The
   scene grew and moved to Blitz wine bar in Covent Garden after a year,
   becoming an incubator for the creative movers and shakers who would
   shape the following decade. The sartorial one upmanship reached
   stratospheric heights when hundred year old costumier Charles Fox
   closed its doors in 1980, selling off its stock for pennies on the
   pound. The press became enthralled by the peacockery, dubbing them the
   New Romantics, a title they hated. But the die had been cast and the
   club kid was born.

   Leigh Bowery got wind of nocturnal London's colorful characters and
   decided to up sticks to the English capital from Sunshine, Australia in
   1980. i-D, The Face and Blitz were all born that same year, putting the
   party participants on their covers. It would be seven years before
   Bowery would land the cover of i-D, but he would grace their pages as
   early as 1983.

   Bowery's

   1980s London captures the exciting London club scene. It is a touching
   photographic catalogue showcasing the unbridled creative spirit and
   wiggy, wayward glamour of that era. It also resurrects the names of a
   few forgotten but undeniably talented creators like John Flett, who
   invented a new bias cutting technique which infused his garments with a
   liquid languidness, and Elmaz Hüseyin, who created the clothing for pop
   group ABC when they reinvented themselves as clubtastic cartoons in
   1984. The book closes with "The Afterparty", a profile of some of the
   original participants, their sartorial innovativeness intact after
   decades, a touching way to honor the people who made the styles, and
   the party, happen.

   Although the flounces and bows associated with the New Romantic look
   all but disappeared by the end of 1981, extreme sartorial expressions
   did not. Cha Cha, which opened in `81 in the back of Heaven, Europe's
   largest gay disco, was hosted by angular Blitz habutée Scarlett Cannon
   and future stylist extraordinaire Judy Blame. Cha Cha would be Bowery's
   entré into café society, confirming his desire for outlandish
   presentation. Philip Sallon, whose flamboyant appearance pre-dated
   punk, hosted the wildly successful Mud Club in 1983, providing a more
   legitimate space for the exotically clad. That same year, Bowery began
   to make waves on the nightclub scene as a blue faced spectacle in
   stripy tights and ass revealing jacket.

   Bowery launched his own club night, Taboo, in 1985. Initially sluggish,
   it exploded after a few months, becoming the hottest and most difficult
   club to gain access to if you were not dressed to the nines. Its run
   was brief, about a year, brought down by drug use and deaths. But at
   its peak, it was the most colorful playground of stylistic expression
   London had ever seen. And what did they wear? Perhaps a jacket trimmed
   in bobby pins or a pair of frilly underwear as designed by Bowery
   himself? Or maybe John Crancher's white maxi coat with bondage straps
   or Bodymap's stretchy, stripy jerseys. Dean Bright's sumptuously velvet
   creations as worn by singer Pete Burns of Dead Or Alive in their video
   for "You Spin Me Round" might have gotten you past Marc Vaultier,
   Taboo's notorious doorman. It could have been one of Pam Hogg's color
   blocked, body skimming catsuits designed to make one look like a
   futuristic Emma Peel. Maybe a Christopher Nemeth jacket upcycled from
   old mail sacks, topped off with one of Judy Blame's berets festooned
   with buttons and ribbons. A John Galliano jacket from his Ludic Game
   collection, abbreviated to barely there proportions? Stephen Linard's
   biker jacket in orange and black faux tiger fur would have looked good
   on the amyl scented dancefloor. One of Richard Torry's ingeniously
   laddered knitwear pieces would have surely done the trick. Whatever it
   was, it has found a commemorative document in Outlaws.
