SHOP.CASE -- a.PRESSE

   By Editors Fashion Feb 12, 2025
   Tags: a.PRESSEshibuyaTokyo

   The shop of a.PRESSE, the Japanese brand that is currently making a lot
   of noise amongst menswear enthusiasts, is located in a nondescript
   concrete building in upper Jingumae, in Tokyo, a ten minute walk from
   the hubbub of the winding streets above Omotesando, which have been
   taken over by mainstream streetwear brands.

   But walk into the semi-basement space and that is where all the
   anonymity ends. The walls and columns are clad in a compound made of
   soil, straw, sand, and cement, giving them a texture somewhere between
   concrete and Venetian plaster. The furniture is a mix of mid-century
   Brazilian and Danish, and the speakers are vintage JBL. The brass
   clothes racks and even the oak wood hangers, are custom made for
   a.PRESSE. Such minute attention to detail adds warmth and makes the
   sparseness of the space an asset in itself.

   a.PRESSE, Tokyo, Shibuya, Jingumae, 2 Chome-5-4 B1F.
