StyleZeitgeist Podcast: NEMESIS with Emily Segal

   On this episode we speak with Emily Segal, the founder of the brand
   strategy agency Nemesis, publishing house Deluge, and the author of the
   novel Mercury Retrograde. Emily came to fame in the 2010s as the
   co-founder of the collective K-Hole, which coined the term "normcore."
   She went on to work with everyone from Prada to Supreme, and learned a
   few things along the way, some of which we discuss in this episode. We
   mostly concentrate on two pieces of her writing, the Umami Theory of
   Value and B for Balenciaga, a brand case study. We discuss why the
   current culture feels like a postmodernist, meaningless,
   made-for-Instagram slop, or as Emily writes, "Umami is what you got
   when you did not get anything," why Balenciaga is a cultural apex
   predator, a vortex that sucks in cultural artifacts and spits them out
   as memes, why Demna's irony is hollow, whether he will succeed at
   Gucci, and much more besides.
