   We are back with Philippe Pourhashemi to review the women's Fall /
   Winter 2025 season. We discuss the debuts of Veronica Leoni at Calvin
   Klein, Haider Ackermann at Tom Ford, Sarah Burton at Givenchy, and
   Julian Klausner at Dries Van Noten. We also give our impressions of
   what is likely to be the last collection of Daniel Lee at Burberry, and
   dive into the shows of Undercover, Rick Owens, Comme des Garçons and
   more.
