   On this episode we speak with Robert Williams, Luxury Editor at the
   Business of Fashion. We start with Robert's unique career journey as an
   American student in Paris (it wasn't like Emily's), before going on to
   discuss the challenges of maintaining independence in fashion
   journalism. We explore the evolving landscape of the fashion industry
   over the past decade, discussing the intersection of fashion and
   marketing, the challenges faced by the fashion media, and the impact of
   consumer behavior on luxury fashion. We examine why heritage brands
   want to be luxury fashion brands, and the pricing dilemmas that have
   emerged as brands strive to maintain their luxury status while
   appealing to a mass audience. In the end Robert turns tables and asks
   Eugene about his upcoming book and for fashion reading recommendations.
