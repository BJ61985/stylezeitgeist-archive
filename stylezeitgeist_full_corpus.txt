StyleZeitgeist Podcast: What Luxury? with Robert Williams

   On this episode we speak with Robert Williams, Luxury Editor at the
   Business of Fashion. We start with Robert's unique career journey as an
   American student in Paris (it wasn't like Emily's), before going on to
   discuss the challenges of maintaining independence in fashion
   journalism. We explore the evolving landscape of the fashion industry
   over the past decade, discussing the intersection of fashion and
   marketing, the challenges faced by the fashion media, and the impact of
   consumer behavior on luxury fashion. We examine why heritage brands
   want to be luxury fashion brands, and the pricing dilemmas that have
   emerged as brands strive to maintain their luxury status while
   appealing to a mass audience. In the end Robert turns tables and asks
   Eugene about his upcoming book and for fashion reading recommendations.

   On this episode we speak with Robert Williams, Luxury Editor at the
   Business of Fashion. We start with Robert's unique career journey as an
   American student in Paris (it wasn't like Emily's), before going on to
   discuss the challenges of maintaining independence in fashion
   journalism. We explore the evolving landscape of the fashion industry
   over the past decade, discussing the intersection of fashion and
   marketing, the challenges faced by the fashion media, and the impact of
   consumer behavior on luxury fashion. We examine why heritage brands
   want to be luxury fashion brands, and the pricing dilemmas that have
   emerged as brands strive to maintain their luxury status while
   appealing to a mass audience. In the end Robert turns tables and asks
   Eugene about his upcoming book and for fashion reading recommendations.

The StyleZeitgeist Guide to Kyoto: 2025 Edition

   By Eugene Rabkin Features/Op-Ed, Travel Jan 16, 2025
   Tags: City GuideKyotoTravel

          Panoramic View of Kyoto

   To say that Kyoto is a magical city is like saying that Francis Bacon
   is a great artist - neither words nor pictures can relate the firsthand
   experience. The feeling of peace that washes over you as you stroll the
   zen gardens or feel the wooden floors of Buddhist temples creak under
   your unshod feet. Even the hordes of tourists cannot spoil the
   experience if you are in the right mindset. There is no season when
   Kyoto is not full of visitors, or at least I have not experienced it.
   There are ways to avoid them somewhat by visiting the smaller temples,
   but no way to avoid them by visiting the bigger ones, but visit them
   you must, at least on your first trip. But you would also be missing
   out if you viewed Kyoto as just a temple destination; exploring its
   rich fabric of shops, restaurants, and a maze of architecture is a joy
   in itself. If you want to do it right, you'd probably need a week or
   so.

   I divide this guide roughly into central and North Kyoto to minimize
   time spent getting around the city. Kyoto is bigger than it seems, so I
   highly suggest mapping out your routes. Also, because everything is
   open Friday - Sunday, when it's most touristy, many businesses are
   closed during the week on random days, so check on Google maps, their
   websites, or their Instagram accounts.

   In this guide there will be more ceramics shops rather than clothing,
   since most likely you'll do most of your clothes shopping in Tokyo. The
   few clothing shops I recommend carry the stuff you cannot easily find
   elsewhere. I also include a couple of smaller, less visited temples, as
   the main ones can be easily found.

   I offer a selection of restaurants, but you will note the absence of
   bars. It's not because there are no good bars in Kyoto, but because I
   am usually exhausted by dinner time. Sorry.

   CENTRAL KYOTO:

   Art

          Kyoto City KYOCERA Museum of Art

   KYOTO CITY KYOCERA MUSEUM OF ART - this splendid museum dedicated to
   Japanese craft went through a total renovation a short while ago, and
   is worth a visit as much for the building itself as for its beautiful
   collection.

   KANJIRO'S HOUSE - a perfectly preserved traditional house (machiya) /
   workshop of one of Japan's great ceramicists is a joy to behold, a
   testament to the beauty of Japanese craftsmanship.

   Temples

   KOMYOIN - a lovely temple with a beautiful garden and a tea house where
   you can have a nice bowl of matcha and a sweet while overlooking a
   traditional zen garden.

   Shops - ceramic

          POJ Studio Kyoto

   ESSENCE - this small gallery near the Kyocera Art Museum should
   probably be your first stop, as their selection of ceramics by Japanese
   artisans is consistently excellent, as is their selection of teas.

   POJ Studio - housed in a machiya in Highashiyama, this carefully
   curated gallery has a bit of everything and is absolutely worth a
   visit.

   KYO AMAHARE - another expertly curated ceramics and housewares gallery
   that sells everything from cups to iron kettles. There is also a tea
   room framed by a zen garden that is absolutely worth a visit (reserve
   in advance).

   HIGASHIYA / OGATA - the Ogata empire keeps growing, and we are here for
   it. This Kyoto branch is in the newly opened (and very expensive)
   Shinmonzen hotel renovated by Tadao Ando. Buy some exquisite pottery,
   tea, and sweets, and / or have an afternoon tea in a tranquil space
   overlooking a lovely canal.

   Shops - clothing

   T.T. - Taiga Takashi's Kyoto store in Gion is a wonder to behold. The
   interior is beautiful, and so are his workwear-inspired, roomily cut
   menswear that blends fine and rough natural fabrics.

   AMPLAMP - a small boutique that has a carefully curated selection of
   Japanese menswear brands like Buzz Rickson and NAME. I did not get to
   visit its sister store, PROPHET, but I imagine it is equally as good.

   BARD - this is one of those small stores that exist all over Japan that
   you wonder about how they exist carrying five-ten brands. It has a nice
   selection of Paul Harnden, Guidi, Casey Casey, and a few other brands.

   ARTS & SCIENCE - Sonya Park's mini-empire of impeccably curated shops
   is well-represented in Tokyo with five small, exquisite stores carrying
   its own clothing line plus household objects. You know those stores
   that are so well-done that you want to buy everything, regardless of
   whether you need it or not? A&S is one of them.

   Shops - other

   HOSOO - this historic family-run fabric business does some of the most
   mind-blowing textiles I've ever seen, and the likes of Gucci and LVMH
   have already noticed them. Their flagship gallery is in Kyoto and is
   absolutely worth a visit.

   Y & SONS - this company specializes in traditional Japanese mens dress
   made from absolutely stunning fabrics mostly developed in house. If you
   ever wanted a haori jacket, this is the place to go. They also
   collaborate with brands like Graphpaper and Norwegian Rain. Even if you
   are not interested in buying one, it's absolutely worth a visit, as
   there are beautiful bags, scarves, and knitwear mixed in with the more
   traditional offerings.

   MEDIA SHOP - an expertly well-curated bookshop concentration on art,
   photography, interior design, and architecture. There is also an art
   gallery on the second floor.

   NAKAGAWA MASASHICHI SHOTEN - hailing from Nara, this is one of those
   stores where you go in and realize there is all this lovely stuff that
   you never knew you needed. It's also a prefect stop for buying omiyage,
   the small gifts that you bring back from Japan for your friends and
   family.

   ANGERS - another general goods store full of socks, scarves, notebooks,
   and pens that will make your life complete.

   Restaurants

          Dupree Kyoto

   SUGARI RAMEN - it is rather silly to look for the "best" ramen in
   Japan, because it ranges from good to fabulous, unless you are in an
   obviously super touristy area. I like this spot as much for its
   impeccable restaurant design as for their ramen, which you will be
   eating out of hammered metal bowls.

   ISAMI SUSHI - this shockingly inexpensive sushi spot run by a
   master-chef father and his son may not have one of those mind-bending
   cuts of fish at those $150 omakase restaurants, but it's excellent
   nonetheless and utterly charming in its unpretentiousness.

   DUPREE - if you want to eat nothing but Japanese food in Kyoto, I
   understand, but you will also be missing out. This French restaurant is
   absolutely outstanding, from its lovely interior, to their excellent
   collection of jazz records, to the exquisite food and a beautiful
   selection of natural wines.

   KI KYOTO - this Mediterranean spot is excellent from start to finish.

   VERMILLION CAFE - two things are not easy to find in Japan, a full
   Western style breakfast and vegan / vegetarian food. Vermillion Cafe
   does both well, and its outside space overlooks a beautiful pond. The
   spot has been blown and it's full of gaijin, not least because it's
   next to Fushimi Inari shrine, but that has not compromised the
   experience. Most people will order the excellent Vermillion breakfast
   plate here, but don't sleep on their amazing hummus with seasonal
   vegetables and other vegetable-centered offerings.

   Coffee / Tea

   Just like with ramen, looking for the best cup of coffee in Japan is
   useless. Even their Starbuck is pretty damn good. So if you see an
   indie spot with a good coffee machine, just go. Nevertheless, I'm
   throwing in a few of my favorites.

   SOT - a small independent roastery in Higashiyama that serves an
   excellent cup of coffee and sells its own beans.

   FUKU ROASTERY - even smaller than SOT, with just a couple of tiny
   benches, run by a true coffee fanatic who roasts beans from from all
   over the world right behind the tiny counter. Some beans are roasted
   with whisky, rum, and sake. You should come here if you are a pour-over
   fan - this is not a latte spot. And you will most likely end up buying
   beans for your home.

   Blue Bottle Higashiyama - Tokyo and Kyoto has no shortage of beautiful
   Blue Bottle locations, but this was my favorite. It will be crowded and
   full of tourists, but worth it if you are in the area.

   0MA - it's a bit out of the way, but it's an unforgettable tea ceremony
   experience run by a young master who refurbished a machiya that is zen
   beyond zen.

   NORTHERN KYOTO:

   Shops

   MITTAN - this Kyoto-based brand mixes the traditional and the modern,
   with roomy, comfortable clothing made from natural materials. They also
   make beautiful blankets.

   STARDUST KANA - you should come here for the beautifully rustic cafe
   that serves lovely cakes and tea, which you will need to reserve, and
   stay for the small selection of clothing by the likes of Mittan and
   Jan-Jan Van Essche, as well as their fantastic Chinese tea selection.
   They also have an art gallery nearby called Elbereth.

   KAMISOE - this tiny shop that specializes in karakami, the traditional
   art of hand printing decorative paper using woodblocks, sells almost
   nothing, but it's a really special place. You will want their hand-made
   greeting cards, which you will use for very special occasions.

   Temples

   Kinkakuji - The Golden Pavillion is touristy but worth visiting. It's
   absolutely stunning.

   Restaurants

   AMAN LIVING PAVILLION - frankly I hesitate to recommend it, because the
   food is 7 out of 10 and expensive, but it is a way to experience a
   glimpse of Aman if you want to. You will be dining in a beautiful room
   and can enjoy a partial view of the property. During my lunch, the
   dessert was the best part, so you are probably better off doing an
   afternoon tea there, but you'll need to reserve far in advance. I've
   also heard good things about Aman's onsen, which is open to the public.

   KUSHIAGE OMOTO - deep-fried food on sticks? Technically, yes, but one
   that makes for an amazing course-meal in a lovely spot run by a husband
   and wife duo, with a small but excellent sake selection. It's one of
   those intimate experiences you won't forget, starting with a salad that
   will remind you what vegetables should really taste like and ending
   with excellent dessert.

   Kyoto Hotels

   Like with everything else, I am only recommending the hotels I've
   stayed in. I love staying in Higashiyama, as it is both central enough
   and out of the way enough, so it is quiet and largely devoid of
   tourists.

   TASSEL HOTEL - a lovely, inexpensive hotel in Higashiyama that is
   almost too good to be true for the prices they charge. Spotlessly
   clean, comfortable, with the breakfast room overlooking a small canal.

   JUNMEI HIGASHIYAMA - a bit pricier than Tassel, but an absolutely
   gorgeous experience worth every penny and then some. The rooms are
   spacious, beautiful, and all come with an onsen. Impeccable service and
   you will want to experience the traditional Japanese breakfast at the
   hotel's restaurant, which you will need to reserve in advance. If you
   want to stay more central, they have a sister hotel by the imperial
   palace, which I imagine is every bit as good as that one.

   Practical tips:

   Don't be a dumb gaijin and respect local customs. Don't be loud, be
   cognizant of personal space, and learn a few phrases in Japanese, like
   greetings and thanks. Contrary to popular belief, few Japanese speak
   English. Google Translate is your friend.

   Take out cash. While Japan has made huge strides in accepting credit
   cards, many smaller restaurants are still cash only.

   Make reservations for restaurants well in advance. Many are small and
   fill up quickly.

   Get an IC transit card, like Suica or Pasmo. You can now simply create
   a virtual one on your phone from your Apple Wallet (and I imagine the
   Android equivalent as well).

   Taxis are fairly inexpensive in Kyoto, so use them. You can hail one or
   you can sign up for Didi, the Uber equivalent. Or you can take the bus,
   for which you can pay with coins or a 1,000 yen bill, or with an IC
   card.

   Bring nice socks, because you will be in plenty situations that require
   you to take your shoes off.

   Avoid food / drink to go, because just like in Tokyo, it is painfully
   hard to find trash bins. Sit down and relax even at the most casual
   spots - you will need rest anyway.

   Bring a half-empty suitcase, because you will inevitably overbuy.

The Best Theory of Why People Buy Fashion Was Written 125 Years Ago

   By Eugene Rabkin Fashion, Features/Op-Ed Feb 7, 2024
   Tags: Fashionop-ed

   Much ink has been spilled through the decades on theories - cultural,
   economic, behavioral - about how we consume fashion. Some have their
   merits, others don't. But no theory has come close to accurately
   describing it than that of the American economist Thorstein Veblen.

   In 1899, Veblen published a book titled The Theory of the Leisure Class
   that aimed to offer to the American economists, at the time obsessed
   with mathematic efficiency, a different theory of why people engage in
   consumption.

   With this book, that eventually took on a life of its own outside of
   the narrow academic circles by morphing into a sociological study,
   Veblen was pointing out to his colleagues that they were making a
   serious mistake in not considering the behavioral and cultural aspects
   of consumption. To him most consumption was status-driven, and
   therefore absolutely irrational in its rationale. The gist of his
   argument was this; in the first degree consumption is driven by the
   rich - the leisure class - who acquire markers of status in order to
   signal their wealth, and the rest of society consumes in order to
   emulate their behavior. This goes for everything from houses, to cars,
   to vacations, and of course, fashion. Veblen coined the term for what
   the leisure class does - conspicuous consumption - that is still widely
   used. As for the rest, their behavior is classified as aspirational
   consumption. The two are closely related cousins.

   Fashion was the only consumption category to which Veblen devoted an
   entire chapter. To him fashion was the most obvious avenue for
   conspicuous consumption, because fashion is on constant display. He
   postulated that in contemporary society being wealthy on its own is not
   enough, and that one must constantly signal their wealth in order to
   signal their status. And while houses and their interiors, yachts, and
   art on your walls are important signifiers of wealth, they do not have
   the same signaling power as clothes do, because they are not constantly
   seen by others. You cannot wear your art to a restaurant (though these
   days you can put it on Instagram, which has been one of the biggest
   drivers of speeding up consumption for household goods). Whereas before
   the industrial revolution and the rise of the modern city the rich
   largely socialized in private, in Veblen's time their spheres of
   socialization increasingly shifted to public places, requiring constant
   signaling of status, which made the clothes ever more important.

   But consuming luxury fashion, according to Veblen, is simply the first
   step on the ladder of providing "evidence of pecuniary success." One
   must not only consume it, but do it often, because conspicuous
   consumption is driven by conspicuous waste. It is not enough for the
   rich to simply buy, the true display of pecuniary (that is monetary)
   strength lies in the fact that they can discard their perfectly fine
   clothes at a regular interval in order to buy new ones. This is really
   what drives the artificial and arbitrary changes in fashion, though in
   order to hide this fact, "The law of conspicuous waste guides
   consumption in apparel, as in other things, chiefly at the second
   remove, by shaping the canons of taste and decency." In other words,
   Bernard Arnault does not tell you that you must buy LVMH products often
   - the magazines, beholden to advertisers, and your peers, influenced by
   the magazines, will tell you that.

   And because the rest of society is driven by aspirational consumption,
   over the last 125 years the mentality of conspicuous waste has
   percolated down to accepted social norms, such as the taboo on wearing
   the same outfit twice a week. This emulative behavior is what drives
   fast fashion, by allowing the middle class to emulate the conspicuous
   waste mentality of the rich (see the numerous SHEIN haul videos on
   YouTube and TikTok).

   But conspicuous consumption and conspicuous waste exist in the service
   of the final goal of the rich; to signal that the person who is
   engaging in both does not have to work for a living ("conspicuous
   leisure"). This is why the color white (and other light colors), for
   example, is considered part of the uniform of the wealthy - no sensible
   person engaged in any productive activity (or even one who has to ride
   the New York City subway) would wear a color that can easily be
   stained. White is a color that requires to be chauffeured.

   The law of conspicuous leisure has also shaped other canons of taste.
   For example, in earlier times it was considered uncouth for the members
   of the upper classes to have a tan, because that's what peasants got by
   working outdoors. This changed in the 20th Century with the rise of the
   white collar worker. All of a sudden a tan signified that you did not
   spend countless hours at the office but had money and time to lay on a
   beach (presumably by taking a private plane to St. Tropez). Today, the
   toned body is the main marker of conspicuous leisure, because its
   possessor signals that they have significant time and money to devote
   oneself to wellness, the new religion of the rich.

   Because the rich are emulated by the rest, they constantly have to move
   the goalposts of what constitutes a status marker, so as not to be
   confused with the rest. To illustrate, let's bring it back to fashion.
   Luxury fashion used to be the purview of the rich. In Veblen's time,
   for a rich woman changing outfits was a full time job (I once toured a
   Vanderbilt mansion and the guide told us that the women vacationing
   there changed outfits eight times a day.) But through the emulative
   process, eventually luxury fashion has become thoroughly ingrained in
   the middle class (the poor buy the knockoffs), and so the rich had to
   shift how they dress. Enter athleisure.

   The fact that athleisure is now worn largely outside of its intended
   purpose - exercise - hints at the cult of wellness. But it began even
   more subtly; athleisure first was worn by rich women outside because it
   signaled roughly the following statement, "Oh, I just decided to grab a
   coffee / brunch after my yoga class around the corner from my SoHo loft
   / Park Avenue apartment / Beverly Hills mansion." By wearing athleisure
   these women signaled that while any dentist's wife from New Jersey can
   now afford a logoed Gucci belt, she cannot afford expensive
   real-estate. By now of course the middle class has caught on, and even
   those who, as evidenced by their body size, cannot engage in wellness
   because they have to work for a living, can engage in status-emulating
   behavior by stretching Lycra over their ample curves. (The rich are
   quietly moving the goalposts again, hence all the talk of "quiet
   luxury," as per Veblenian law of the second remove.)

   The only thing Veblen has not foreseen - how could he, in 1899 - is the
   new class of the rich, and that is the entertainers. Money caché is now
   often matched by cultural caché, and the former now often comes from
   the latter. (W. David Marx explores this phenomenon in his recent book,
   Status and Culture, where he distinguishes between financial capital
   and cultural capital.) And the mechanisms for dissemination of status
   signaling have changed and amplified due to social media. This is how
   you get the celebrity-fashion industrial complex and Pharrell designing
   Louis Vuitton menswear. But though the makeup of the classes to be
   emulated and the machinery for signaling status may have changed, the
   essential principles for consuming fashion postulated by Veblen have
   remained the same. To illustrate, I will leave you with this 2019
   masterpiece from GQ, "The Enormous Appetites of Lil Uzi Vert."

What Karl Marx Can Teach Us About the Current State of Fashion

   Fashion, Features/Op-EdBy Eugene RabkinMar 27, 2025

   There's something rotten in the state of fashion. The kingdom of dreams
   seems to no longer be capable of producing them. Instead it has swamped
   its subjects in the sea of overpriced premium mediocre stuff, causing
   fatigue and boredom. What does an umpteenth collab or a logoed tee mean
   today? Nothing.

   But what does Marx's theory have to do with fashion? It helps to unpack
   one of central concepts of Das Kapital, exchange value versus use
   value. Marx's basic position is this: in the pre-capitalist economy,
   most things, including clothing, were produced by highly skilled
   artisans who were capable of crafting an object, let's say a coat, from
   start to finish, and were also likely to sell the product of their
   labor directly; which means that they fully identified with their labor
   and were invested into everything they made. By nature of their
   production, they could not make very much, and many things they made
   was quite expensive, which in turn limited the consumer's purchasing
   power. And so when the consumer did acquire an object, say the
   aforementioned coat, they would value it for its essential properties,
   such as protecting him from the elements, keeping him warm, and making
   him look presentable. Marx called this use value, the stuff that gave a
   coat its coatness, making that object real and concrete.

Trump, the Unwitting Sustainability Warrior

   FashionBy Eugene RabkinApr 11, 2025

   Take a deep breath, and suspend your justified knee-jerk reaction at
   mentioning Trump before you read on, as I had to do in order to write
   this article.

   There is much debate about the economic damage of Trump's harsh tariff
   policies. Even though most tariffs have been suspended for 90 days,
   let's go ahead with the scenario in which they go into effect. Many
   outcomes are still hazy, but one thing is clear, they will likely
   decrease consumption, especially in America. And in the world of
   overconsumption, isn't that what so many of us who are concerned with
   sustainability want? The developed world, and the US especially, groans
   under the weight of cheap stuff that the current world economy,
   especially in Asia, overproduces, and that ends up in landfills. The
   cycle of planned obsolescence has sped up across the board, but
   especially in fashion, where we no longer talk about fast fashion from
   the likes of H&M, but about ultra-fast-fashion from the likes of the
   Chinese giant Shein.

Unpacking Kering's Earnings

   FashionBy Eugene RabkinApr 23, 2025

   Today, Kering, the luxury conglomerate that owns Gucci, Yves Saint
   Laurent, Balenciaga, and Bottega Veneta, among others, reported its
   first quarter earnings, and the picture of the luxury industry it
   paints is even more dire than many thought. Overall sales are down by
   14%, Gucci's sales for the first three months of 2025 are down by 25%,
   as Kering's biggest brand flounders in the wake of a creative director
   reshuffling. At Yves Saint Laurent, its second biggest brand, sales are
   down 9%. Frustratingly, Kering does not break out Balenciaga's
   earnings, as it lumps them into "Other Houses," which include McQueen,
   Brioni, and a handful of jewelry brands they own. But Kering dropped a
   couple of hints in its earnings report.

OUTLAWS: Fashion Renegades Of Leigh Bowery's 1980s London

   FashionBy Karlo SteelApr 23, 2025

   That burst of angry, youthful energy unleashed on London streets in
   1976 called punk indelibly changed the trajectory of nightclubbing
   forever. For about eighteen months, sartorial individuality reigned for
   those initial participants. Although Westwood and McLaren's SEX and
   Seditionaires boutique provided expensive garments infused with the
   spikily subversiveness forever associated with punk, DIY styling rose
   like a rocket within those months with a slew of customization ideas
   utilized to express disaffection, nihilism and sexual deviation.

Duran Lantink's Appointment to Gaultier Proves That Contemporary Fashion Is a
Simulation

   FashionBy Eugene RabkinApr 15, 2025

   Today we woke up to the news that the up and coming designer Duran
   Lantink was appointed as the creative director of Jean Paul Gaultier.
   This completes his recent victory lap that began with sweeping a
   handful of fashion prizes, including the Andam award and the LVMH
   prize.

   And while it is commendable that a young designer gets a crack at
   spearheading one of the most important brands in the history of
   contemporary fashion, it's also worth taking a fresh look at what he
   actually makes. The artifacts that can be called garments in his oeuvre
   are pretty forgettable - there is no innovation there in terms of the
   silhouette, nor is there a strong discerning aesthetic statement.
   Lantink's true strength lies in making outlandish, sculpted outfits
   that look good on Instagram. The look from his last collection that was
   shared the most was not a garment at all, but a sculpted male bust,
   worn on a female model. Things like this are designed to go viral in
   that look-at-this-silly-thing way. They are fashion as memes.

Superfine: Tailoring Black Style at the Met Museum in New York

   FashionBy Karlo SteelMay 9, 2025

   Superfine, an exhibition on Black dandyism which opens this Saturday at
   The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, presents a history of Black
   style through the lense of dandyism, emphasizing the importance of
   sartorial style to Black identity formation in the Atlantic diaspora
   and the ways Black designers have interpreted and reimaged this
   history. The exhibition aims to highlight the various styles one could
   employ in order to be identified as a dandy: from austere minimalism to
   hyper-colorful tailoring, from deconstructed denim to high tech
   sportswear, dispelling the stereotype of flamboyance being the only
   indicator of dandyism.

The StyleZeitgeist Guide to Paris: 2025 Edition

   Features/Op-Ed, TravelBy Eugene RabkinFeb 13, 2025

   On some level writing a guide to Paris is an exercise in futility. What
   can one write about a city where you can get a good glass of wine and a
   decent meal in so many places - as long as you stay away from the
   touristy areas - and where there is no such thing as the best bakery,
   since you can only get bread that is either fine or excellent.
   Therefore, this guide to Paris is the guide to what I have gotten to
   know over the years of traveling to the City of Light.

   I've been to Paris about fifty times, I've walked it back and forth,
   and I know I am not nearly close to discovering all the good things it
   has to offer and have not sufficiently explored all of its
   neighborhoods (for example, I rarely find myself in Montmartre, or in
   Charonne, and some day I'd like to eat my way through rue des Martyrs).
   I've not been to the 20th arrondissement, which is where the epicenter
   of hipsterdom has moved to. I have not yet been to the Catacombs (very
   ungoth of me), and I've never had any luck record shopping in Paris. So
   this guide is flawed and deeply personal, and I am all ears if you want
   to add to it.

MEN'S FALL / WINTER 2025 PARIS FASHION WEEK REPORT

   Fashion, Features/Op-EdBy Eugene RabkinJan 29, 2025

   This January Paris greeted us with rain and more rain. In the seven
   days I saw sun only once - proof that god hates fashion. The weather
   put a damper on a season that was already decidedly mid. If fashion is
   supposed to reflect our culture, what it tells us is that our culture
   is mired in mediocrity. Note that I did not say that it was an awful
   season, nor am I particularly disappointed, which means that I got
   exactly what I expected - mids. Pretty much all the editors I've spoken
   with this season did not expect much either. We've capitulated to
   fashion in the say way the American left has capitulated to Trump. We
   shrug our shoulders because we know what to expect. We troop from one
   show to another without much joy and without much anticipation. We are
   tired; what was once fun is starting to look an awful lot like work.

AT PITTI UOMO SETCHU ASKS MORE OF US BY ASKING LESS

   Fashion, Features/Op-EdBy Eugene RabkinJan 17, 2025

   "We are not a fashion company," said Satoshi Kuwata, the designer of
   SETCHU, emphatically, after showing a foldable origami blazer he
   developed with Davies & Son, the oldest Saville Row tailor. We were at
   the press preview for his show at Pitti Uomo, the premier men's trade
   show in Florence. It was the first SETCHU show, and, according to
   Kuwata, most likely its last; the reason being that Kuwata's clothes
   require careful examination, not to say contemplation.

PARIS MENS FALL / WINTER 2025 SHOWROOM REPORT

   Fashion, Features/Op-EdBy Eugene RabkinJan 30, 2025

   Last year I promised to lean into supporting smaller brands, and I have
   valiantly tried to visit as many showrooms as possible, so much so that
   I have not seen much of Paris this time. Each season I receive an
   avalanche of invitations, but I am just one person, so I am taking an
   opportunity to offer my apologies to those I was not able to visit. In
   general, many of the brands I've seen have stuck to their guns. This is
   fine, but it also does not provide much food for thought. Quite a few
   are struggling, but I hope that now that the so-called luxury is in
   tailspin, it's their time to come in and offer a superior product at a
   better price. There is certainly a contingent of men and women ready
   for it. And I see it as my job to connect these brands with a new
   audience. So, here it is.

History of Contemporary Fashion: 1947 - Present

          Coco Chanel, gelatin silver print, Richard Avedon | National
          Museum of American History; Christian Dior (right) with
          Alexander Liberman | Archives of American Art; Pierre Cardin by
          Eddie Adams for Time Magazine | National Portrait Gallery;
          Clothes by Miyake, photos by Irving Penn | Cooper Hewitt


   This college level, 15-session study will offer a comprehensive
   overview of the history of contemporary fashion, concentrating on the
   period from 1947 until now. From Dior's New Look, through the decline
   of haute couture and the rise of pret-a-porter, the life and death of
   the avant-garde, to today's conglomerate fashion, this course will
   examine how fashion has changed over the past 75 years, connecting a
   patchwork of designers, brands, and trends into a coherent narrative
   that will give the students a solid understanding of the contemporary
   fashion landscape.


   The full syllabus is available upon request by writing to
   info@sz-mag.com or by DMing @stylezeitgeist on Instagram.


   The course proceeds decade by decade, tying together disparate fashion
   movements and putting them into a wider cultural and theoretical
   context. From the haute couture of Christian Dior and Yves Saint
   Laurent, to the punk fashions of Malcolm McLaren and Vivenne Westwood,
   to the French camp revolutionaries Jean Paul Gaultier and Thierry
   Mugler, to the avant-garde of Comme des Garçons and Yohji Yamamoto, to
   the Antwerp Six and Martin Margiela, to the minimalists Helmut Lang and
   Jil Sander, to the British enfant terribles Alexander McQueen and John
   Galliano, to Rick Owens; these are just some of the names whose work we
   will closely examine. We will also examine the rise of menswear and
   streetwear, and the corporatization of fashion in the early 21st
   Century.


     * The course curriculum is modeled on a full semester worth of
       studying at a higher educational institution.
     * Each session will be a mix of lecture and seminar, meaning that the
       students will be encouraged to actively participate in discussions.
     * There will be assigned reading, but no written homework or a final
       project, unless you are willing to do one as part of the advanced
       study program.
     * For the Spring 2025 semester, the course is taught once a week, on
       Sundays from 12 p.m. to 2 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.
     * Schedule: February 2nd, 2025 - May 18th, 2025 (a spring break TBA)
     * Tuition: early bird $999 (register before January 20th, 2025) /
       regular tuition $1299 / advanced study $1499 (includes four
       personal consultations with the instructor)


   Please note that the course is limited to 20 students.

Dolce & Gabbana at Grand Palais, Paris

   By Eugene Rabkin Culture, Fashion Jan 31, 2025

   When future historians will examine the list of crimes against humanity
   of our time, the work of Dolce & Gabbana will feature prominently, or,
   as they say in fashion, boldly. The current exhibition of the dismal
   duo's oeuvre at Grand Palais in Paris drives this point home with such
   ferocious force as to make one's eyes bleed from all the ludicrous
   pomposity on display. Mistitled Du Coeur a la Main, it should have been
   called The Kingdom of Kitsch, because that's what Domenico Dolce and
   Stefano Gabbana have built, both at their brand and with this show at
   one of the world's most venerable museums, whose stones are undoubtedly
   groaning with shame at having been burdened with so much bad taste.

   The shame of Grand Palais is evident in the fact that the exhibit is
   held off to the side of the palace, and at its start features a
   decidedly unglamorous staircase that makes one wonder why we must enter
   through the servant quarters to get to the main rooms. Once inside,
   however, you'll be wishing for the unadorned simplicity of the
   staircase, because adornment is all you'll be seeing for the rest of
   your journey through the nine circles of fashion hell befitting Dante's
   worst nightmares. You will see gold. You will see lots of gold. You
   will see so much gold that your brain will think that gold is all there
   is. You will be vomiting gold by the end.

   The show is held on two floors and is broken down into various rooms
   with different themes. But there is a unifying element to the exhibit,
   sartorial kitsch. Because Dolce & Gabbana have been turning out kitsch
   for the last thirty years, we have forgotten how elegant their
   beginnings were in the late `80s and the early `90s. What happened
   after that is anybody's guess - maybe they saw Gianni Versace's
   success, or maybe they were simultaneously struck by lightning. It is
   entirely possible that some people think that what D&G produce is High
   Camp, a la Gaultier (or even Versace for that matter). Let this
   reviewer disabuse you of this notion. For the work of Dolce & Gabbana
   is heavy with self-importance and utterly humorless. The exhibition
   serves, if it serves any purpose at all besides being a major
   advertising vehicle for the brand, as a testament to that.

   But, to the details. The exhibition starts with a series of highly
   ornamental ensembles meant to evoke Italian art heritage, particularly
   the Renaissance. There are jackets heavily embroidered with images of
   famous Italian paintings, including Portrait of a Musician by Leonardo
   Da Vinci, which I happened to see by chance ten days before at
   Pinacoteca Ambrosiana in Milan. (I prefer the painting.)

   Aligning with Italian cultural heritage has been one of D&G's calling
   cards. Undoubtedly they see themselves as part of the great Italian
   cultural lineage, which was evidenced by the amazing Leonardo Da Vinci
   clock that they restored and donated to the Pinanoteca, but only after
   slapping their logo on it. Here it must be said that just because Dolce
   and Gabbana are Italian does not guarantee that that they are heirs to
   Da Vinci any more than Fedez is an heir to Vivaldi. Speaking of which,
   in this atrocity exhibition the pair also tries to latch on to Italian
   opera and classical music. Whom are they kidding? We all know that in
   reality they listen to Dua Lipa as background noise while FaceTiming
   with Kourtney Kardashian, so she can order a dress embroidered with
   "G.PUCCINI, MADAMA BUTTERFLY" on it, even though she wouldn't know
   Puccini from a cappuccino.

   But I fear I am running ahead of myself, because before you get to the
   opera room you must pass through various other circles of visual hell.
   One of these features a Byzantine Christian theme weirdly combined with
   the Roman and the Greek, as evidenced in a mannequin of a legionnaire
   who holds Zeus' thunderbolts in one hand against a backdrop of a golden
   icon. Not that one expects historical accuracy from Dolce & Gabbana -
   the point is that the art of the Byzantine empire had gold and jewels
   and gold and jewels are really what D&G are after. And Jesus, do they
   deliver on that front. I am confident that this exhibition caused a
   worldwide shortage of gemstones and golden thread, which in turn
   undoubtedly contributed to global inflation. There were gemstones on
   everything and everything with gemstones. And not just the clothes. The
   shoes - dear lord - THE SHOES! There were golden slippers with gems,
   velvet slippers with pearls, golden and velvet slippers with gems and
   pearls. It was unmerciful, which is, by the way, un-Christian.

   But back to Italy. Did you know that Domenico Dolce is from Sicily and
   the pair is inspired by the beautiful island? You didn't?! Don't worry,
   there is a room for that too, one where folklore turns into kitsch
   through visual overload. The floors and the walls of this room are
   covered in colorful Sicilian tiles featuring cocks and feathers and
   happy peasant women. Only the ceiling is left untouched - a missed
   opportunity. On display in this apoplectically colorful room are videos
   showing the wonderful Sicilian craftsmen debasing themselves for
   Domenico and Stefano's pleasure, as well as some highly feathered
   ensembles. And if the clothes are not enough, there are also Dolce &
   Gabbana x Bialetti stovetop coffee makers on display, which you can now
   - wink, wink - purchase in stores.

   Are you not entertained?! Then proceed to another room, this one
   highlighting D&G's tailoring skills. You will see half-finished
   jackets, tailored shirt collars, videos of impeccable handwork. So much
   savoir faire to serve so much bad taste, alas.

   The exhibit loops around like a gaudy Mobius strip, and by the time you
   are out it all feels like one seizure-inducing blur. If the curators
   had mercy on their audience, the show would end with an entirely black
   room, so the visitors can decompress. And there are visitors aplenty -
   it was crowded and most time slots that were not on a Monday were sold
   out. Perhaps this show will beat some kind of an attendance record. And
   there is one record it will hold beyond a shadow of a doubt, for no
   museum has ever seen so much gaudiness per square foot.

The StyleZeitgeist Guide to Antwerp : 2025 Edition

   Features/Op-Ed, TravelBy Eugene RabkinFeb 20, 2025Leave a comment

   It is hard to believe that we have not updated our Antwerp guide since
   2013, what with it being one of my favorite cities in Europe. What
   keeps pulling me back to this city, besides professional obligations?
   Fashion, obviously, as well as a mix of medieval and contemporary
   architecture, with some Art Nouveau buildings thrown...

The StyleZeitgeist Guide to Paris: 2025 Edition

   Features/Op-Ed, TravelBy Eugene RabkinFeb 13, 2025

   On some level writing a guide to Paris is an exercise in futility. What
   can one write about a city where you can get a good glass of wine and a
   decent meal in so many places - as long as you stay away from the
   touristy areas - and where there is no such thing as the best bakery,
   since you can only get bread that is either fine or excellent.
   Therefore, this guide to Paris is the guide to what I have gotten to
   know over the years of traveling to the City of Light.

   I've been to Paris about fifty times, I've walked it back and forth,
   and I know I am not nearly close to discovering all the good things it
   has to offer and have not sufficiently explored all of its
   neighborhoods (for example, I rarely find myself in Montmartre, or in
   Charonne, and some day I'd like to eat my way through rue des Martyrs).
   I've not been to the 20th arrondissement, which is where the epicenter
   of hipsterdom has moved to. I have not yet been to the Catacombs (very
   ungoth of me), and I've never had any luck record shopping in Paris. So
   this guide is flawed and deeply personal, and I am all ears if you want
   to add to it.

The StyleZeitgeist Tokyo Guide: 2025 Edition

   Culture, TravelBy Eugene RabkinFeb 6, 2025

   For the aesthetically inclined and designed conscious there is probably
   no better place on earth than Tokyo. And for science fiction fans it's
   probably the closest thing to encountering another humanoid
   civilization - things are similar enough and foreign enough in Tokyo to
   make it all the more exciting, even though in the last couple of years
   the intractable march of globalization of culture has left an indelible
   stamp on the city. I've been to Tokyo three times and by now feel
   confident enough to write a guide of sorts. Because there is so much to
   do and see here, I decided that the best approach is to break it down
   by neighborhood rather than the list of places, because there are too
   many of them. Tokyo is vast - don't even think about spending less than
   a week here. I'll list the neighborhoods more or less in order of
   preference or proximity to each other. Aside from these
   recommendations, the best advice I can give you is to get lost in the
   wonderful maze of Tokyo's streets - because the best spots are often in
   the back alleys off the main thoroughfares. You'll need your GPS.

The StyleZeitgeist Guide to Kyoto: 2025 Edition

   Features/Op-Ed, TravelBy Eugene RabkinJan 16, 2025

   To say that Kyoto is a magical city is like saying that Francis Bacon
   is a great artist - neither words nor pictures can relate the firsthand
   experience. The feeling of peace that washes over you as you stroll the
   zen gardens or feel the wooden floors of Buddhist temples creak under
   your unshod feet. Even the hordes of tourists cannot spoil the
   experience if you are in the right mindset. There is no season when
   Kyoto is not full of visitors, or at least I have not experienced it.
   There are ways to avoid them somewhat by visiting the smaller temples,
   but no way to avoid them by visiting the bigger ones, but visit them
   you must, at least on your first trip. But you would also be missing
   out if you viewed Kyoto as just a temple destination; exploring its
   rich fabric of shops, restaurants, and a maze of architecture is a joy
   in itself. If you want to do it right, you'd probably need a week or
   so.

The StyleZeitgeist Guide to London: 2024 Edition

   TravelBy Eugene RabkinOct 22, 2024

   In any other year I would probably be in London today. Think of this
   guide as an exercise in catharsis, and not only for me. Perhaps you'll
   read it and it will inspire you to visit London whenever you can travel
   again.

StyleZeitgeist Japan Guide to New York City

   Features/Op-Ed, TravelBy Eugene RabkinDec 4, 2020

   Japan is my favorite place to travel to. I cannot do this now, but I
   can still visit all the Japanese or Japan-inspired places in New York.

Alaia Mugler at La Foundation Azzedine Alaia

   By Editors Culture, Fashion Feb 28, 2025
   Tags: Azeddine AlaiaThierry Mugler

          Azzedine Alaïa by Alice Springs

          Thierry Mugler by Alice Springs


   Few designers defined the 1980s the way Azzedine Alaïa and Thierry
   Mugler have. At first glance their work could not be further apart -
   Alaïa, the master of sexy discreetness, Mugler the master of bombastic
   sexiness. Alaia, demure in his respect for Parisian tradition, Mugler
   breaking with all haute couture conventions. Alaïa was serious about
   women, Mugler saw them as characters. Alaïa, building a temple of
   sophistication, Mugler building a church to Camp.

   And yet, the two shared more than a first glance would have you believe
   - Mugler had as much respect for craft as Alaïa did, ending up at
   Lanvin instead of Dior because it allowed him to become a couturier.
   Alaïa has been quietly working on his own, word-of-mouth after he left
   Christian Dior in 1956, dressing a private clientele. He was known
   among those who knew.

   Meanwhile, Mugler seemingly burst out of nowhere in the late '70s and,
   along with Claude Montana and Jean Paul Gauliter, remade Paris in just
   a few years. And he revered Alaïa. For his Fall / Winter 1979
   collection, Mugler invited Alaïa to design a series of tuxedos for his
   fashion show. The two became friends, and Mugler encouraged Alaïa to
   officially start his own brand, which Alaïa did the same year. Mugler
   brought prominent fashion editors to his studio, helping to jump-start
   Alaia's career. And some of early Alaïa's work was not that far from
   Mugler's - look, for example, at Alaia's Fall / Winter 1991 collection,
   and you will find a black leather jacket with broad shoulders and a
   nipped waist, paired with a black leather mini skirt.

   The unlikely friendship between the two giants of Parisian fashion is
   now celebrated in the exhibition Azzedine Alaïa 1980/1990: Two Decades
   of Artistic Affinities at the Foundation Azzedine Alaïa in Paris. Alaia
   was an avid collector of other designers' work, and Mugler was no
   exception. Alaïa ended up with over 200 pieces from Mugler, 40 of which
   are on display, juxtaposed against Alaïa's own work. The exhibit is a
   testament to a lasting friendship that can often come from unlikeliest
   of sources.

MEN'S FALL / WINTER 2025 PARIS FASHION WEEK REPORT

   This January Paris greeted us with rain and more rain. In the seven
   days I saw sun only once - proof that god hates fashion. The weather
   put a damper on a season that was already decidedly mid. If fashion is
   supposed to reflect our culture, what it tells us is that our culture
   is mired in mediocrity. Note that I did not say that it was an awful
   season, nor am I particularly disappointed, which means that I got
   exactly what I expected - mids. Pretty much all the editors I've spoken
   with this season did not expect much either. We've capitulated to
   fashion in the say way the American left has capitulated to Trump. We
   shrug our shoulders because we know what to expect. We troop from one
   show to another without much joy and without much anticipation. We are
   tired; what was once fun is starting to look an awful lot like work.

   This season felt like it was my busiest ever, even though I've attended
   the least amount of shows - no Ann Demeulemeester, which is in
   perpetual limbo, no Yohji Yamamoto, where rappers are now preferred to
   editors, no Dries Van Noten, which is in transition - the showrooms
   made up for it. Fashion is now in a peculiar state - it seems like the
   conglomerates have never had so much power, making it virtually
   impossible to build an independent brand, and at the same time there
   are more brands than ever before. How are they all surviving is beyond
   me.

   My first show was Auralee, the newish kid on the Paris block, though
   the brand is turning ten this year. Ryota Iwai's lovely clothes hardly
   require a show, but a show has become an indispensable part of being on
   high fashion's radar. Looking at Auralee's output in a show format
   makes little sense, but here it is; it started out slowly and then
   built up to something more intricate, leather biker jackets under
   coats, puffers over suits, all in all a fine outing, thought not
   terribly exciting. The excitement happens in the showroom as you run
   your fingers over baby cashmere and the fine wools, and try on the
   clothes that feel both new and lived in and intimate.

   My next presentation was Lemaire, car number two on the quiet luxury
   express. The brand is riding high - according to a recent Business of
   Fashion article it's pulling in 100 million euros a year - and its
   newfound swagger was reflected in that of the models who sashayed with
   uncharacteristic, for Lemaire, confidence down the runway, layered in
   the brand's signature neutrals. Can a sexy librarian swagger? Perhaps.
   Broken down though, there wasn't much new to look at; same staples in a
   new mixture. I file Lemaire under a it-is-what-it-is rubric - the brand
   does not need to change much as its fan base grows around its
   tried-and-true offerings.
   AURALEE
   LEMAIRE
   (BUTTON)


   On Thursday morning I dropped by the Dries Van Noten presentation.
   Dries Van Noten is not a huge brand - these days one cannot be huge
   while selling clothes - and I imagine the mandate from Puig, its owner,
   is to grow it. It looks like the strategy is to grow DVN by making it
   look younger, which we already saw with the last, uncharacteristically
   bare skin-heavy show. As far as this men's presentation went, Julian
   Klausner, the brand's new creative director, clearly thinks that
   "young" means effeminate. This is a peculiar proposition in the age
   where an unprecedented number of young straight men are interested in
   fashion. Dries's man was self-assured and defined in broad enough
   strokes to appeal to a wide variety of customers. Klausner's
   proposition does not. One must wonder whether the example of Sebastian
   Meunier feminizing the Ann Demeulemeester man and alienating scores of
   brand's core clients in the process was not enough of an example - one
   next door, mind you - to give Dries Van Noten the brand pause.
   Apparently not. And one more thing; I am pretty confident that there
   are photographers other than the utterly predictable Willy Vanderperre
   out there. No wonder everything looks the same these days.

   Then it was off to the Rick Owens show. Set to the soundtrack of
   various iterations of David Bowie's "Heroes," Owens showed that
   savoir-faire need not be the exclusive preserve of the polished luxury
   houses. The braided leathers on the boots, the masterfully frayed edges
   of jeans, and short sleeve, high-necked tops made of layers of rubber
   were feats of sartorial achievement. I also loved - and I was in the
   minority there - the simplicity of the outerwear, where a few sweeping
   lines were enough to make a statement. The silhouette was all over the
   place - a best of - with cropped jackets and huge pants, with long
   coats over shorts, and leggings tucked into boots. The casting was
   strong, with several older men overshadowing the usual young whippets.
   And yet, somehow the show failed to truly move, the way Porterville did
   a year ago. Perhaps the difference between this show and that was the
   difference between the demanding but haunting "Warszawa" and the
   irresistible but easily digestible "Heroes."

   RICK OWENS

   My once-a-day show regiment was broken Friday, the day of Comme. First
   it was Junya Watanabe, who failed to wow this time. His modern day
   cowboys and truck drivers were too literal and tiring. Our culture's
   pining for the good old days when men were men in the Wild West, as
   reflected in shows like the wildly successful Yellowstone and its
   various offshoots, watched by the subdued white-collar male whose
   spirit has withered long ago under the weight of his regimented life,
   is, frankly, embarrassing. This phenomenon is not new, but at least
   Fight Club was fun and had a whiff of counterculture to it, as did
   Watanabe's shows that were based on the likes of the Taxi Driver.

   It was Rei Kawakubo at Comme des Garçons that had something relevant to
   say this time, about the sickness and the absurdity of war. The spliced
   uniforms worked like a charm, as did the crazy shoes that turned
   upwards like a barrel of an unusable weapon. Mama put those guns into
   the ground with gusto.

   My first show on Saturday was Hermes, and it was as confident as ever.
   Some people find Hermes menswear underwhelming. I don't, but then, I
   don't look at Hermes menswear as fashion - I see at as simply
   beautiful, sumptuous, luxurious clothes. Do they need a show? Not
   really. What would work for Hermes menswear in a show is if it was
   styled up a bit to give it more energy.

   There was plenty of energy at Y-3. Once again, like so much this
   season, I looked at it through it-is-what-it-is lens. The best bits
   were Yamamoto's original silhouettes reworked as techwear. There was
   also another unnecessary Neighborhood collab, this one centered around
   motorcycle racing. It's main feature was lots of bold lettering; ok.

   The last show of the day was that of the Japanese brand Kolor. It was
   held in one of my favorite venues, the former Communist Party
   headquarters by Oscar Niemeyer. But instead of using its stunning main
   hall, as before, this time Junichi Abe stuck us in the brutalist
   basement. It was as if he was signaling something, and it was indeed,
   the end of his tenure at the brand that he founded. This was pretty
   shocking, and the new designer was announced two days after the show. I
   don't know what exactly happened, and no one else did either. Farewell,
   then, to a talented designer. As for the collection itself, it was
   fittingly timid for a coda.
   JUNYA WATANABE
   COMME DES GARÇONS
   (BUTTON)


   Could somebody, anybody, save this season? Enter Sacai. Few designers
   are as consistent and consistently good as Chitose Abe. Though it's
   evident that she thinks that she too needs pop-cultural crutches - this
   collection featured artwork from Where the Wild Things Are, the wildly
   popular children's book - the brilliant clothes stood on their own just
   fine, particularly the spliced two-tone trenches. But the fact that
   even the designer as talented as Abe relies on pop culture to move
   units speaks to the cultural moment we are in - where EVERYTHING is
   entertainment and kidults rule the world.

   I suppose this makes a neat circle; I started with culture and ended
   with it, too. And fashion is part of culture, and the reason I fell in
   love with it in the first place. But the culture that I fell for is
   largely gone, and so is fashion that was in dialogue with it. Except
   Undercover, which presented a showless collection based on experimental
   German and French bands like Faust and Heldon. Someone must carry the
   torch after all.

   The above is not an entirely fair ending, because I also attended Peter
   Copping's debut at Lanvin. But since it was really a co-ed outing
   tacked on at the end of the menswear season, I am treating it
   separately. As far as trial runs go it was fine. I'll start with the
   good - it's nice to see a creative director at the helm of a
   traditional French house who actually knows how to design. The
   womenswear was a testament to that, and there were outfits in there
   that clearly signaled skill and talent. Having said that, the first
   outing is also your first impression and no time to be timid,
   especially at the time when the industry segment Lanvin is in is in
   tailspin. The outfits that had edge, like several made of black boucle,
   were overshadowed by evening ensembles that would make Carolina Herrera
   proud. There is a way to do Parisian high bourgeois chic - the intended
   direction of the house - without making it look passé (see, Anthony
   Vaccarello's recent efforts at Saint-Laurent). And while there was
   coherence in Copping's womenswear, the menswear looked like an
   afterthought - a common disease of creative directors of big houses who
   still think that men don't care about fashion. It was all over the
   place and the best looks had a whiff of Dries Van Noten to them.
   Whether the faults of the debut are all with Copping is impossible to
   say - big brands are at the mercy of businesspeople, accountants,
   consultants, and merchandisers. But, for better or worse, it is the
   creative director that must own successes and failures of a house in
   the eyes of the public who can only judge by what's shown to them on
   the runway. I am still rooting for Copping and hoping for a stronger
   second outing.

   This January Paris greeted us with rain and more rain. In the seven
   days I saw sun only once - proof that god hates fashion. The weather
   put a damper on a season that was already decidedly mid. If fashion is
   supposed to reflect our culture, what it tells us is that our culture
   is mired in mediocrity. Note that I did not say that it was an awful
   season, nor am I particularly disappointed, which means that I got
   exactly what I expected - mids. Pretty much all the editors I've spoken
   with this season did not expect much either. We've capitulated to
   fashion in the say way the American left has capitulated to Trump. We
   shrug our shoulders because we know what to expect. We troop from one
   show to another without much joy and without much anticipation. We are
   tired; what was once fun is starting to look an awful lot like work.

   This season felt like it was my busiest ever, even though I've attended
   the least amount of shows - no Ann Demeulemeester, which is in
   perpetual limbo, no Yohji Yamamoto, where rappers are now preferred to
   editors, no Dries Van Noten, which is in transition - the showrooms
   made up for it. Fashion is now in a peculiar state - it seems like the
   conglomerates have never had so much power, making it virtually
   impossible to build an independent brand, and at the same time there
   are more brands than ever before. How are they all surviving is beyond
   me.

   My first show was Auralee, the newish kid on the Paris block, though
   the brand is turning ten this year. Ryota Iwai's lovely clothes hardly
   require a show, but a show has become an indispensable part of being on
   high fashion's radar. Looking at Auralee's output in a show format
   makes little sense, but here it is; it started out slowly and then
   built up to something more intricate, leather biker jackets under
   coats, puffers over suits, all in all a fine outing, thought not
   terribly exciting. The excitement happens in the showroom as you run
   your fingers over baby cashmere and the fine wools, and try on the
   clothes that feel both new and lived in and intimate.

   My next presentation was Lemaire, car number two on the quiet luxury
   express. The brand is riding high - according to a recent Business of
   Fashion article it's pulling in 100 million euros a year - and its
   newfound swagger was reflected in that of the models who sashayed with
   uncharacteristic, for Lemaire, confidence down the runway, layered in
   the brand's signature neutrals. Can a sexy librarian swagger? Perhaps.
   Broken down though, there wasn't much new to look at; same staples in a
   new mixture. I file Lemaire under a it-is-what-it-is rubric - the brand
   does not need to change much as its fan base grows around its
   tried-and-true offerings.

          AURALEE

          LEMAIRE


   On Thursday morning I dropped by the Dries Van Noten presentation.
   Dries Van Noten is not a huge brand - these days one cannot be huge
   while selling clothes - and I imagine the mandate from Puig, its owner,
   is to grow it. It looks like the strategy is to grow DVN by making it
   look younger, which we already saw with the last, uncharacteristically
   bare skin-heavy show. As far as this men's presentation went, Julian
   Klausner, the brand's new creative director, clearly thinks that
   "young" means effeminate. This is a peculiar proposition in the age
   where an unprecedented number of young straight men are interested in
   fashion. Dries's man was self-assured and defined in broad enough
   strokes to appeal to a wide variety of customers. Klausner's
   proposition does not. One must wonder whether the example of Sebastian
   Meunier feminizing the Ann Demeulemeester man and alienating scores of
   brand's core clients in the process was not enough of an example - one
   next door, mind you - to give Dries Van Noten the brand pause.
   Apparently not. And one more thing; I am pretty confident that there
   are photographers other than the utterly predictable Willy Vanderperre
   out there. No wonder everything looks the same these days.

   Then it was off to the Rick Owens show. Set to the soundtrack of
   various iterations of David Bowie's "Heroes," Owens showed that
   savoir-faire need not be the exclusive preserve of the polished luxury
   houses. The braided leathers on the boots, the masterfully frayed edges
   of jeans, and short sleeve, high-necked tops made of layers of rubber
   were feats of sartorial achievement. I also loved - and I was in the
   minority there - the simplicity of the outerwear, where a few sweeping
   lines were enough to make a statement. The silhouette was all over the
   place - a best of - with cropped jackets and huge pants, with long
   coats over shorts, and leggings tucked into boots. The casting was
   strong, with several older men overshadowing the usual young whippets.
   And yet, somehow the show failed to truly move, the way Porterville did
   a year ago. Perhaps the difference between this show and that was the
   difference between the demanding but haunting "Warszawa" and the
   irresistible but easily digestible "Heroes."

          DRIES VAN NOTEN

          RICK OWENS


   My once-a-day show regiment was broken Friday, the day of Comme. First
   it was Junya Watanabe, who failed to wow this time. His modern day
   cowboys and truck drivers were too literal and tiring. Our culture's
   pining for the good old days when men were men in the Wild West, as
   reflected in shows like the wildly successful Yellowstone and its
   various offshoots, watched by the subdued white-collar male whose
   spirit has withered long ago under the weight of his regimented life,
   is, frankly, embarrassing. This phenomenon is not new, but at least
   Fight Club was fun and had a whiff of counterculture to it, as did
   Watanabe's shows that were based on the likes of the Taxi Driver.

   It was Rei Kawakubo at Comme des Garçons that had something relevant to
   say this time, about the sickness and the absurdity of war. The spliced
   uniforms worked like a charm, as did the crazy shoes that turned
   upwards like a barrel of an unusable weapon. Mama put those guns into
   the ground with gusto.

   My first show on Saturday was Hermes, and it was as confident as ever.
   Some people find Hermes menswear underwhelming. I don't, but then, I
   don't look at Hermes menswear as fashion - I see at as simply
   beautiful, sumptuous, luxurious clothes. Do they need a show? Not
   really. What would work for Hermes menswear in a show is if it was
   styled up a bit to give it more energy.

   There was plenty of energy at Y-3. Once again, like so much this
   season, I looked at it through it-is-what-it-is lens. The best bits
   were Yamamoto's original silhouettes reworked as techwear. There was
   also another unnecessary Neighborhood collab, this one centered around
   motorcycle racing. It's main feature was lots of bold lettering; ok.

   The last show of the day was that of the Japanese brand Kolor. It was
   held in one of my favorite venues, the former Communist Party
   headquarters by Oscar Niemeyer. But instead of using its stunning main
   hall, as before, this time Junichi Abe stuck us in the brutalist
   basement. It was as if he was signaling something, and it was indeed,
   the end of his tenure at the brand that he founded. This was pretty
   shocking, and the new designer was announced two days after the show. I
   don't know what exactly happened, and no one else did either. Farewell,
   then, to a talented designer. As for the collection itself, it was
   fittingly timid for a coda.

          JUNYA WATANABE

          COMME DES GARÇONS


   Could somebody, anybody, save this season? Enter Sacai. Few designers
   are as consistent and consistently good as Chitose Abe. Though it's
   evident that she thinks that she too needs pop-cultural crutches - this
   collection featured artwork from Where the Wild Things Are, the wildly
   popular children's book - the brilliant clothes stood on their own just
   fine, particularly the spliced two-tone trenches. But the fact that
   even the designer as talented as Abe relies on pop culture to move
   units speaks to the cultural moment we are in - where EVERYTHING is
   entertainment and kidults rule the world.

   I suppose this makes a neat circle; I started with culture and ended
   with it, too. And fashion is part of culture, and the reason I fell in
   love with it in the first place. But the culture that I fell for is
   largely gone, and so is fashion that was in dialogue with it. Except
   Undercover, which presented a showless collection based on experimental
   German and French bands like Faust and Heldon. Someone must carry the
   torch after all.

   The above is not an entirely fair ending, because I also attended Peter
   Copping's debut at Lanvin. But since it was really a co-ed outing
   tacked on at the end of the menswear season, I am treating it
   separately. As far as trial runs go it was fine. I'll start with the
   good - it's nice to see a creative director at the helm of a
   traditional French house who actually knows how to design. The
   womenswear was a testament to that, and there were outfits in there
   that clearly signaled skill and talent. Having said that, the first
   outing is also your first impression and no time to be timid,
   especially at the time when the industry segment Lanvin is in is in
   tailspin. The outfits that had edge, like several made of black boucle,
   were overshadowed by evening ensembles that would make Carolina Herrera
   proud. There is a way to do Parisian high bourgeois chic - the intended
   direction of the house - without making it look passé (see, Anthony
   Vaccarello's recent efforts at Saint-Laurent). And while there was
   coherence in Copping's womenswear, the menswear looked like an
   afterthought - a common disease of creative directors of big houses who
   still think that men don't care about fashion. It was all over the
   place and the best looks had a whiff of Dries Van Noten to them.
   Whether the faults of the debut are all with Copping is impossible to
   say - big brands are at the mercy of businesspeople, accountants,
   consultants, and merchandisers. But, for better or worse, it is the
   creative director that must own successes and failures of a house in
   the eyes of the public who can only judge by what's shown to them on
   the runway. I am still rooting for Copping and hoping for a stronger
   second outing.

Superfine: Tailoring Black Style at the Met Museum in New York

   FashionBy Karlo SteelMay 9, 2025

   Superfine, an exhibition on Black dandyism which opens this Saturday at
   The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, presents a history of Black
   style through the lense of dandyism, emphasizing the importance of
   sartorial style to Black identity formation in the Atlantic diaspora
   and the ways Black designers have interpreted and reimaged this
   history. The exhibition aims to highlight the various styles one could
   employ in order to be identified as a dandy: from austere minimalism to
   hyper-colorful tailoring, from deconstructed denim to high tech
   sportswear, dispelling the stereotype of flamboyance being the only
   indicator of dandyism.

OUTLAWS: Fashion Renegades Of Leigh Bowery's 1980s London

   FashionBy Karlo SteelApr 23, 2025

   That burst of angry, youthful energy unleashed on London streets in
   1976 called punk indelibly changed the trajectory of nightclubbing
   forever. For about eighteen months, sartorial individuality reigned for
   those initial participants. Although Westwood and McLaren's SEX and
   Seditionaires boutique provided expensive garments infused with the
   spikily subversiveness forever associated with punk, DIY styling rose
   like a rocket within those months with a slew of customization ideas
   utilized to express disaffection, nihilism and sexual deviation.

Calder: Sculpting Time

   CultureBy Karlo SteelDec 11, 2024

   The introduction of movement into sculpture. That implausible leap from
   the static to the temporal. Alexander Calder, the inventor of the
   mobile, achieved what the great Hellenistic sculptors could only
   suggest in the windblown robe and fluttering wings of Nike of
   Samothrace. He broke the mold. Jean Paul Sartre described Calder's
   mobiles as "mid-way between matter and life". They are a composition of
   motions, a series of fleeting moments where balance, force and tension
   coexist in perfect harmony. Calder: Sculpting Time (published by
   Silvana Editorial, $50.00) covers MASILugano's ambitious exhibition in
   168 pages, highlighting his most prolific era, the 1930s to 1960s.

Book Review: Madame Grès Couture Paris

   FashionBy Karlo SteelNov 1, 2024

   Madame Grès Couture Paris, recently published by Rizzoli, is the latest
   book by fashion historian and curator Olivier Saillard. Saillard, whose
   extensive accomplishments at Paris' Palais Galleria are credited with
   invigorating an interest in fashion beyond that of the more established
   Musée des Arts Décoratifs, is one of the leading voices on the work of
   Madame Grès. His recent "Alaïa / Grès" exhibition at the Alaïa
   Fondation, and "Madame Grès, The Art Of Draping" at SCAD last year,
   continues to further the legacy of one of the most innovative
   couturiers in the history of fashion.

Peter Hujar Behind The Camera And In The Darkroom

   CultureBy Karlo SteelOct 15, 2024

   Gary Schneider arrived in New York City from Cape Town in 1976, landing
   a job doing technical work for an avant garde theater in Soho. Through
   his partner, he met artist photographer Peter Hujar with whom he had an
   immediate rapport as he was interested in photography and printing.
   Hujar secured Schneider a job at a printers where he began to print
   Hujar's work, and in the process becoming a close friend, protége,
   assistant and occasional subject for Hujar's lens. Their relationship
   is now commemorated in a new book Peter Hujar Behind The Camera And In
   The Darkroom (D.A.P. $50, out now).

Unpacking Kering's Earnings

   FashionBy Eugene RabkinApr 23, 2025

   Today, Kering, the luxury conglomerate that owns Gucci, Yves Saint
   Laurent, Balenciaga, and Bottega Veneta, among others, reported its
   first quarter earnings, and the picture of the luxury industry it
   paints is even more dire than many thought. Overall sales are down by
   14%, Gucci's sales for the first three months of 2025 are down by 25%,
   as Kering's biggest brand flounders in the wake of a creative director
   reshuffling. At Yves Saint Laurent, its second biggest brand, sales are
   down 9%. Frustratingly, Kering does not break out Balenciaga's
   earnings, as it lumps them into "Other Houses," which include McQueen,
   Brioni, and a handful of jewelry brands they own. But Kering dropped a
   couple of hints in its earnings report.

Duran Lantink's Appointment to Gaultier Proves That Contemporary Fashion Is a
Simulation

   FashionBy Eugene RabkinApr 15, 2025

   Today we woke up to the news that the up and coming designer Duran
   Lantink was appointed as the creative director of Jean Paul Gaultier.
   This completes his recent victory lap that began with sweeping a
   handful of fashion prizes, including the Andam award and the LVMH
   prize.

   And while it is commendable that a young designer gets a crack at
   spearheading one of the most important brands in the history of
   contemporary fashion, it's also worth taking a fresh look at what he
   actually makes. The artifacts that can be called garments in his oeuvre
   are pretty forgettable - there is no innovation there in terms of the
   silhouette, nor is there a strong discerning aesthetic statement.
   Lantink's true strength lies in making outlandish, sculpted outfits
   that look good on Instagram. The look from his last collection that was
   shared the most was not a garment at all, but a sculpted male bust,
   worn on a female model. Things like this are designed to go viral in
   that look-at-this-silly-thing way. They are fashion as memes.

Trump, the Unwitting Sustainability Warrior

   FashionBy Eugene RabkinApr 11, 2025

   Take a deep breath, and suspend your justified knee-jerk reaction at
   mentioning Trump before you read on, as I had to do in order to write
   this article.

   There is much debate about the economic damage of Trump's harsh tariff
   policies. Even though most tariffs have been suspended for 90 days,
   let's go ahead with the scenario in which they go into effect. Many
   outcomes are still hazy, but one thing is clear, they will likely
   decrease consumption, especially in America. And in the world of
   overconsumption, isn't that what so many of us who are concerned with
   sustainability want? The developed world, and the US especially, groans
   under the weight of cheap stuff that the current world economy,
   especially in Asia, overproduces, and that ends up in landfills. The
   cycle of planned obsolescence has sped up across the board, but
   especially in fashion, where we no longer talk about fast fashion from
   the likes of H&M, but about ultra-fast-fashion from the likes of the
   Chinese giant Shein.

What Karl Marx Can Teach Us About the Current State of Fashion

   Fashion, Features/Op-EdBy Eugene RabkinMar 27, 2025

   There's something rotten in the state of fashion. The kingdom of dreams
   seems to no longer be capable of producing them. Instead it has swamped
   its subjects in the sea of overpriced premium mediocre stuff, causing
   fatigue and boredom. What does an umpteenth collab or a logoed tee mean
   today? Nothing.

   But what does Marx's theory have to do with fashion? It helps to unpack
   one of central concepts of Das Kapital, exchange value versus use
   value. Marx's basic position is this: in the pre-capitalist economy,
   most things, including clothing, were produced by highly skilled
   artisans who were capable of crafting an object, let's say a coat, from
   start to finish, and were also likely to sell the product of their
   labor directly; which means that they fully identified with their labor
   and were invested into everything they made. By nature of their
   production, they could not make very much, and many things they made
   was quite expensive, which in turn limited the consumer's purchasing
   power. And so when the consumer did acquire an object, say the
   aforementioned coat, they would value it for its essential properties,
   such as protecting him from the elements, keeping him warm, and making
   him look presentable. Marx called this use value, the stuff that gave a
   coat its coatness, making that object real and concrete.

The StyleZeitgeist Guide to Antwerp : 2025 Edition

   Features/Op-Ed, TravelBy Eugene RabkinFeb 20, 2025Leave a comment

   It is hard to believe that we have not updated our Antwerp guide since
   2013, what with it being one of my favorite cities in Europe. What
   keeps pulling me back to this city, besides professional obligations?
   Fashion, obviously, as well as a mix of medieval and contemporary
   architecture, with some Art Nouveau buildings thrown...

The StyleZeitgeist Guide to Paris: 2025 Edition

   Features/Op-Ed, TravelBy Eugene RabkinFeb 13, 2025

   On some level writing a guide to Paris is an exercise in futility. What
   can one write about a city where you can get a good glass of wine and a
   decent meal in so many places - as long as you stay away from the
   touristy areas - and where there is no such thing as the best bakery,
   since you can only get bread that is either fine or excellent.
   Therefore, this guide to Paris is the guide to what I have gotten to
   know over the years of traveling to the City of Light.

   I've been to Paris about fifty times, I've walked it back and forth,
   and I know I am not nearly close to discovering all the good things it
   has to offer and have not sufficiently explored all of its
   neighborhoods (for example, I rarely find myself in Montmartre, or in
   Charonne, and some day I'd like to eat my way through rue des Martyrs).
   I've not been to the 20th arrondissement, which is where the epicenter
   of hipsterdom has moved to. I have not yet been to the Catacombs (very
   ungoth of me), and I've never had any luck record shopping in Paris. So
   this guide is flawed and deeply personal, and I am all ears if you want
   to add to it.

The StyleZeitgeist Tokyo Guide: 2025 Edition

   Culture, TravelBy Eugene RabkinFeb 6, 2025

   For the aesthetically inclined and designed conscious there is probably
   no better place on earth than Tokyo. And for science fiction fans it's
   probably the closest thing to encountering another humanoid
   civilization - things are similar enough and foreign enough in Tokyo to
   make it all the more exciting, even though in the last couple of years
   the intractable march of globalization of culture has left an indelible
   stamp on the city. I've been to Tokyo three times and by now feel
   confident enough to write a guide of sorts. Because there is so much to
   do and see here, I decided that the best approach is to break it down
   by neighborhood rather than the list of places, because there are too
   many of them. Tokyo is vast - don't even think about spending less than
   a week here. I'll list the neighborhoods more or less in order of
   preference or proximity to each other. Aside from these
   recommendations, the best advice I can give you is to get lost in the
   wonderful maze of Tokyo's streets - because the best spots are often in
   the back alleys off the main thoroughfares. You'll need your GPS.

Dolce & Gabbana at Grand Palais, Paris

   Culture, FashionBy Eugene RabkinJan 31, 2025

   When future historians will examine the list of crimes against humanity
   of our time, the work of Dolce & Gabbana will feature prominently, or,
   as they say in fashion, boldly. The current exhibition of the dismal
   duo's oeuvre at Grand Palais in Paris drives this point home with such
   ferocious force as to make one's eyes bleed from all the ludicrous
   pomposity on display. Mistitled Du Coeur a la Main, it should have been
   called The Kingdom of Kitsch, because that's what Domenico Dolce and
   Stefano Gabbana have built, both at their brand and with this show at
   one of the world's most venerable museums, whose stones are undoubtedly
   groaning with shame at having been burdened with so much bad taste.

PARIS MENS FALL / WINTER 2025 SHOWROOM REPORT

   Fashion, Features/Op-EdBy Eugene RabkinJan 30, 2025

   Last year I promised to lean into supporting smaller brands, and I have
   valiantly tried to visit as many showrooms as possible, so much so that
   I have not seen much of Paris this time. Each season I receive an
   avalanche of invitations, but I am just one person, so I am taking an
   opportunity to offer my apologies to those I was not able to visit. In
   general, many of the brands I've seen have stuck to their guns. This is
   fine, but it also does not provide much food for thought. Quite a few
   are struggling, but I hope that now that the so-called luxury is in
   tailspin, it's their time to come in and offer a superior product at a
   better price. There is certainly a contingent of men and women ready
   for it. And I see it as my job to connect these brands with a new
   audience. So, here it is.

MEN'S FALL / WINTER 2025 PARIS FASHION WEEK REPORT

   Fashion, Features/Op-EdBy Eugene RabkinJan 29, 2025

   This January Paris greeted us with rain and more rain. In the seven
   days I saw sun only once - proof that god hates fashion. The weather
   put a damper on a season that was already decidedly mid. If fashion is
   supposed to reflect our culture, what it tells us is that our culture
   is mired in mediocrity. Note that I did not say that it was an awful
   season, nor am I particularly disappointed, which means that I got
   exactly what I expected - mids. Pretty much all the editors I've spoken
   with this season did not expect much either. We've capitulated to
   fashion in the say way the American left has capitulated to Trump. We
   shrug our shoulders because we know what to expect. We troop from one
   show to another without much joy and without much anticipation. We are
   tired; what was once fun is starting to look an awful lot like work.

AT PITTI UOMO SETCHU ASKS MORE OF US BY ASKING LESS

   Satoshi Kuwata by Stefano Galuzzi
   (BUTTON)

   "We are not a fashion company," said Satoshi Kuwata, the designer of
   SETCHU, emphatically, after showing a foldable origami blazer he
   developed with Davies & Son, the oldest Saville Row tailor. We were at
   the press preview for his show at Pitti Uomo, the premier men's trade
   show in Florence. It was the first SETCHU show, and, according to
   Kuwata, most likely its last; the reason being that Kuwata's clothes
   require careful examination, not to say contemplation.

   Although Kuwata has twenty years of design experience, SETCHU seems to
   have sprung out of nowhere, fully formed. In 2023, Kuwata won the LVMH
   prize for young designers, despite his long tenure working behind the
   scenes at places as disparate as Saville Row and Golden Goose, Givenchy
   and Yeezy. An inside source told me that SETCHU was not initially in
   the running to win the prize because there was no hype around Kuwata.
   But when the committee saw the clothes, there was no doubt in their
   mind that they were in the presence of genuine talent. The fashion
   world concurs -- the enthusiasm amongst professionals around SETCHU is
   universal. An invitation from Pitti Uomo to put on a show is a
   confirmation in itself -- while the fair organizers pride themselves on
   keeping their ear to the ground for emerging talent, it is not often
   that a brand gets invited with only several collections under its belt.

   One can see why enthusiasm around SETCHU is contagious -- after years
   of creative directors and stylists, the fashion system has finally
   produced a member of that endangered species, a designer. Kuwata thinks
   about building clothes not brands, knowing that the clothes he makes
   will be what will build the brand in the long run. Spend some time with
   Kuwata's garments and you quickly learn the formidable thought process
   that produces clothes that carry ease and complexity in equal measure.

   The first time I met Kuwata was at his Paris showroom shortly after he
   won the LVMH prize, and he walked me through his collection, showing
   the multiple ways his garments can be worn. He possesses a simultaneous
   humility and a dry sense of humor befitting someone who spent time in
   Britain. Demonstrating versatility of his clothes, Kuwata tried on a
   sweatshirt with zippers running along the side seams, and said, "This
   is the regular way you can wear it, but if you are too hot, you can do
   this," unzipping both sides, twisting and pulling up the sweatshirt so
   it now looked like an oversized scarf nonchalantly thrown over the
   shoulders, "and then you look like a Japanese designer."

   Back at the preview Kuwata threw the aforementioned blazer, that will
   be custom-made on Saville Row and cost god knows what, on the floor,
   and in a few swift gestures folded it, like a sweater, along the
   perma-creases running down and across. Though the blazer was
   meticulously constructed - its interlining alone takes double the time
   to make than the standard one - it had an ease to it that modern life
   requires. Kuwata is an avid traveler (and a fisherman), and one of the
   first world problems he tries to solve with his versatile designs is
   overpacking. Hence, garments with built in multifunctionality.

   Another first world problem Kuwata is concerned with is our constant
   complaining (guilty as charged). And it is true that by historical
   standards we live in unprecedentedly good times, which many of us don't
   appreciate. Our lives are fast and furious, and as shallow as those
   silly motor films. To remind us to slow down and to be more
   considerate, Kuwata put on his show at Biblioteca Nazionale Di Firenze,
   and he called it, `I WANT LESS, AND LESS THAN THAT." He urged us to put
   down our phones and pick up a book, an advice few will heed. But there
   is a romanticism in this futility that is alluring (at least to me).

   There is a quiet romanticism in his clothes as well, a softness that is
   welcome in a world that feels increasingly coarse. It was on display at
   the SETCHU show later that evening, as models walked slowly down the
   runway, sometimes in groups of two and three, their heels softly
   click-clacking on the polished stone floor, the garments twisting
   around their bodies without contorting them. The starting point of this
   collection was a square, the most simple of shapes, around which Kuwata
   built an entire wardrobe. The results were fascinating to look at;
   blazers so soft that they could be tucked into pants, dress shirts that
   could be buttoned in a myriad of ways to form a variety of shapes. Some
   of the most compelling items were the simplest ones, zippered hooded
   sweatshirts that were transformed into skirts and capes -- it is rare
   to see something so common given a truly new form and function.

   Though the show was good, it was evident that Kuwata was right when he
   said that the runway is not the right format for his clothes; the sum
   of its parts did not add up to something greater. But as an experiment
   it proved that SETCHU is best experienced one on one, in an intimacy
   that the conversation between the wearer and the garment ultimately
   requires.

Trump, the Unwitting Sustainability Warrior

   Take a deep breath, and suspend your justified knee-jerk reaction at
   mentioning Trump before you read on, as I had to do in order to write
   this article.

   There is much debate about the economic damage of Trump's harsh tariff
   policies. Even though most tariffs have been suspended for 90 days,
   let's go ahead with the scenario in which they go into effect. Many
   outcomes are still hazy, but one thing is clear, they will likely
   decrease consumption, especially in America. And in the world of
   overconsumption, isn't that what so many of us who are concerned with
   sustainability want? The developed world, and the US especially, groans
   under the weight of cheap stuff that the current world economy,
   especially in Asia, overproduces, and that ends up in landfills. The
   cycle of planned obsolescence has sped up across the board, but
   especially in fashion, where we no longer talk about fast fashion from
   the likes of H&M, but about ultra-fast-fashion from the likes of the
   Chinese giant Shein. The consumers are doing nothing to change their
   shopping habits, so, as I have argued before, it will fall on the
   governments to regulate fast fashion. Unwittingly, Trump may be doing
   just that.

   Let's examine Trump's policies in detail. The first thing that jumped
   out at me was not his tariff hikes, but the cancellation of the de
   minimis exemption on goods coming from China. This especially affects
   the ultra fast fashion giant Shein and the general cheap goods colossus
   Temu, which also sells plenty of clothes in the US. These two companies
   - by one estimation Shein is now the biggest clothing retailer in the
   world - have built their business models on shipping goods direct to
   consumers from China. The generous de minimis duty-free allowance of
   $800 on packages crossing into the United States has saved them
   billions of dollars and allowed to keep their prices low. The impact of
   the de minimis cancellation will most likely be significant, as the
   consumer who has been hooked on the drug of ultra low prices is also
   the most price-sensitive, and in all likelihood will most likely be the
   first to pull back spending.

   Next, it's worth examining which countries have been hit with the
   highest tariffs. These include China (145% at this point), Vietnam
   (46%), Bangladesh (37%), and Indonesia (32%), mass market apparel and
   footwear manufacturing giants. In all countries much of what is
   produced for consumption in the West is made in sweatshop conditions
   using exploitative practices. While there is no question that there
   will be economic cost to these countries, long term it may also force
   them to rethink their appalling labor practices. Meanwhile, price
   increases on goods from mass market juggernauts like Nike and Adidas,
   as well as big mid-market fashion companies like Ralph Lauren and
   Coach, should also decrease American overconsumption, as prices rise,
   in some cases as much as 40%, according to a recent Reuters article.
   This also means that the American consumer, whose confidence has been
   lowered due to inflation-inducing Trump's policies, will most likely
   pull back from buying clothing, as they concentrate on purchasing
   necessities and saving. According to a preliminary report by the
   National Federation of Retailers, an American trade body, U.S. imports
   may fall by as much as 20% in the second half of 2025.

   "Democratization of fashion" is how fast fashion companies and mass
   market purveyors of clothing have long defended their role in polluting
   the planet, arguing that cheap prices allow even the Western poor to
   buy style. This defense is nothing but a fig leaf, since the
   overwhelming majority of fast fashion consumers are middle class. Most
   of these clothes are worn a couple of times and discarded, ending up in
   landfills in Africa. One 2018 study estimates that by 2050 global
   consumption of clothing could more than triple. All the sustainability
   solutions can be boiled down to only one thing, we must buy less.

   The messaging we get from the world today is deeply conflicting. Listen
   to the economists, and the economy must grow every year. Listen to the
   ecologists, and we are killing the planet because we make too much
   stuff. There must be a middle ground somewhere. Unwittingly, Trump may
   force us to find it.

The StyleZeitgeist Guide to Antwerp : 2025 Edition

   It is hard to believe that we have not updated our Antwerp guide since
   2013, what with it being one of my favorite cities in Europe. What
   keeps pulling me back to this city, besides professional obligations?
   Fashion, obviously, as well as a mix of medieval and contemporary
   architecture, with some Art Nouveau buildings thrown in for good
   measure, in a place that can be traversed in one long walk. Antwerp has
   a sense of the quiet and the unpretentious mixed with the cosmopolitan.
   Design is in Antwerp's blood, and it punches way above its weight. It
   is also one of the few cities that is spared the waves of mass tourism.

   Antwerp changes constantly. Since my first visit in 2001, when I
   stuffed my backpack into a locker at the stunning Antwerp Central
   Station just to go shop, many designers have gone out of business, and
   their shops closed. I still miss the Veronique Branquinho shop, with
   its VB door handle that is still there, and the Walter Van Beirendonck
   shop with its amazing circular cash wrap suspended from the ceiling and
   manned by his aunt. But new stores have opened in their stead and the
   city is ever vibrant and never ceases to surprise.

   And so, without further ado is a list of my favorite places. As I
   mentioned, Antwerp is small - hence, I am not subdividing it into walks
   or organizing by neighborhoods as I do with larger cities.


   /SEE

   For its size, Antwerp has no shortage of wonderful museums and
   cathedrals.

   MOMU FASHION MUSEUM

   De Kathedraal

   Antwerp's main cathedral is a wonder to behold, as are the two main
   squares around it. The hefty 12 euro admission does get you a chance to
   look at four Paul Rubens paintings, two of which were painted
   specifically for the cathedral. (Website)

   Museum Plantin-Moretus

   This stunningly preserved 16th Century printing house is my favorite
   museum in Antwerp and the city's best-kept secret. Tucked away in a
   small square in the center of town, this jewel of preservation, with
   intact machines and various printing implements, provides a total look
   into how a printing house operated centuries ago. The living quarters
   are also well-preserved and its collection of books and graphics is
   formidable. (Website)

   MoMu

   Around the corner from Plantin-Moretus is MoMu, Antwerp's renowned
   fashion museum that puts on some of the best fashion exhibits in the
   world. Naturally, the focus is often on Belgian designers, which is not
   a complaint but a compliment, but it also happily expands beyond its
   homeland confines. (Website)

   KMSKA

   The Royal Museum of Fine Arts reopened in 2022 after a 100 million euro
   renovation that took eleven years. That's a lot of time and a lot of
   money, which brought back one of the grand institutions of Flemish art
   that is well worth visiting. All of the grand Flemish masters are
   well-represented here, as you might expect. (Website)

   M HKA

   Antwerp is not all about Flemish masters - after all, some of the best
   contemporary artists, such as Luc Tuymans, Berlinde De Bruyckere, and
   Michael Borremans, hail from the Flemish region - and this museum of
   contemporary art is there to remind you of this fact.

   Kloosterstraat

   If antiques is your cup of tea you will be in heaven in Kloosterstraat,
   which is regularly raided by antiques dealers and interior designers
   from London and Paris who then resell the stuff for double the price.
   Kloosterstraat is where the antique shops are concentrated, and since I
   can never remember their names, I advise you to simply walk up and down
   the street.

   Zurenborg

   Some time at the beginning of the 20th Century, the story goes, a
   visionary developer bought a large parcel of land in Antwerp's suburb
   of Berchem and told a bunch of architects to go to town. The result is
   several blocks of absolutely stunning buildings in the Art Nouveau,
   Gothic Revival, Tudor, and other fin-de-siecle styles. If this
   neighborhood was in any major city, it would be mobbed with tourists.
   Here, you will have it all to yourself. I cannot stress enough that
   this is not to be missed, even if it's away from the town center.


   /SHOP

   For the city of its size, the amount and level of shopping in Antwerp,
   from antiques and vintage to high-end, almost makes no sense. But it is
   a rich town with taste, and local spending power is buttressed by the
   influx of moneyed Dutch tourists.

   -FASHION-

   GARDEN ANTWERP

   Atelier Solarshop

   This store is run by the Belgian designer Jan Jan Van Essche. But it's
   more than a boutique with a comprehensive collection of his offerings,
   it's a window into his singular world, with hard to find Japanese
   brands like Mittan, jewelry by Stephanie Schneider, and objects that
   Jan Jan and Pietro pick up on their extensive travels in less traveled
   parts of the world. (Website)

   Kievit / Daniel Andresen

   The German, Antwerp-based knitwear master Daniel Andresen took over a
   disused apothecary in the North-East part of Antwerp a few years ago to
   open his own store, Kievit. It is a splendid space, and Andresen's
   knitting atelier is right behind it, a total farm-to-table model.
   (Website)

   Garden

   This newcomer to Antwerp's burgeoning retail scene is well-stocked with
   avant-garde brands such as Elena Dawson, John Alexander Skelton, and
   Archivio J.M. Ribot. The 19th Century white-washed, marble-accented
   space is grand and inviting and the staff are both knowledgeable and
   welcoming. (Website)

   Graanmarkt 13

   This Antwerp mainstay occupies an entire townhouse in the city center.
   The building was reworked by Vincent Van Duysen, my favorite architect,
   also Antwerp-based. It was one of the earliest stockists for Auralee,
   and has a nice selection of my favorite Belgian object-maker, Michael
   Verheyden, as well as Santa Maria Novella skincare. (Website)

   Houben

   Houben is one of those stores that can only be found in smaller cities.
   They are quirky, they cater to the loyal local clientele, they couldn't
   care less about e-commerce and they will have top tier brands that
   rarely wholesale. When I first encountered it in 2008, it was quietly
   one of the most impressive stockists for Comme des Garçons and Junya
   Watanabe. In its next iteration it had enough of Phoebe Philo's Celine
   to qualify for a shop-in-shop. These days it carries The Row, Alaia,
   and still does a healthy Thom Browne business. (Website, if you can
   call it one)

   Dries Van Noten

   Dries Van Noten's original flagship needs no introduction. It is chic,
   it is beautiful, it is a must.

   Ann Demeulemeester

   Ditto. The renovation that were supervised by Ann's husband, Patrick
   Robyn, has made an already beautiful store even more so. In addition to
   the clothes, the shop now also carries a comprehensive collection of
   Demeulemeester's tableware manufactured by Serax.

   -VINTAGE-

   Since vintage has become an industry it has taken all the fun out of
   bargain-hunting. But not everywhere. Antwerp is the only place besides
   Tokyo where I still like visiting vintage stores.

   Rosier 41

   Your vintage tour should start at Rosier 41, which has an excellent
   selection of Belgian designer and beyond. (Website)

   Labels Inc.

   The OG Antwerp vintage fashion shop. You won't find any bargains here
   anymore, but the curation is top notch. (Website)

   Vrijdagmarkt 6

   This small menswear only shop in the same square as the Plantin-Moretus
   museum is well-curated and is worth a gander. (No website)

   -INTERIOR DESIGN-

   The Flemish love their houses more than their fashion. There is a
   saying, I was told, that they are born with a brick in their stomach.
   Therefore, Antwerp has no shortage of excellent interior design shops.
   I am giving you only a couple, because, well, I cannot bring a chair in
   my suitcase, so there aren't many that I visit.

   THOMAS HAARMANN

   Thomas Haarmann

   Haarmann specializes in high end interior design and his wabi-sabi
   meets brutalism atelier is a testament to his impeccable taste.
   (Website)

   St. Vincents

   One of the most brilliantly curated interior design shops I have ever
   been to, this store-gallery spread over several gutted floors of a
   white-washed building in Central Antwerp is an absolute must. The
   offerings are decidedly high end and expensive, but this is the stuff
   interior design dreams are made of. (Website)

   Books / Records / Art

   Antwerp still has some treasures in the above department, despite
   losing Copyright, a perennial art book favorite of mine, and here are a
   few good spots worth digging through. Unsurprisingly, most are to be
   found around the Royal Academy area in the North-West.

   Panoply

   This local student favorite has a great selection of books, including
   in English language, DVDs, CDs, and records. (Website)

   Demian

   An expertly curated used and rare book and art shop. Highly recommended
   (Website)

   Anti-Quariaat

   This shop, run by one of those characters that our world can no longer
   produce, is a treasure trove of books, signed art posters, and prints.
   You can't even find it on Google maps, let alone the social media. But
   it's next to Demian, so make sure to look for it. (What website? Are
   you kidding?)


   /FOOD AND DRINK

   Produce standards in Belgium are particularly high, and the food in
   Antwerp is outstanding. When I travel, I drink like the locals, which
   in Antwerp means beer and their wonderul mint tea. I encourage you to
   do the same. Here is a selection of places I like.

   In De Roscam

   An utterly charming, local hangout with good food and beer. Super
   casual and always hopping, my longtime favorite. (No website)

   Borze Cafe

   An excellent, unassuming restaurant with fantastic classic food and
   drink menu. (Website)

   Roji

   This upscale sushi restaurant sits in a basement space designed by Axel
   Vervoordt, and the food is as good as the interior. If you don't feel
   like having a full meal, sit at the bar and stare at the roaring
   fireplace. (Website)

   Fiskebar

   A seafood stalwart that was early to the whole hipsterish
   unassuming-decor-excellent-food game, and it's still going strong.
   (Website)

   Camino

   Perhaps my favorite lunch spot in Antwerp. The pan-Asian noodle bowls
   are out of this world. Get the pork belly, obviously. (Website)

   Witzli Poetzli

   This bar is a local creative crowd watering hole right next to the
   central cathedral. A great selection of Belgian beer and a colorful
   clientele. (Bohemians don't need websites)

   Pierre Marcolini

   This Belgian chocolateier has not been a secret for more than a decade,
   but I still think he is the best and is in the pantheon of
   chocolate-making trade for a reason. (Website)

   Revista

   One of my favorite cafes, next to KMSKA and Ann Demeulemeester. Free
   wifi, a nice selection of magazines, good coffee and super fresh
   croissants and sandwiches. (Website)


   /STAY

   Antwerp has no shortage of great, well-designed, and fairly affordable
   accommodations. Remember, design is in the city's blood!

   AUGUST HOTEL

   August

   This is possibly my most favorite hotel in the world. I once told
   Vincent Van Duysen, who designed it, that it was made for me. The rooms
   are absolutely gorgeous in all of their muted glory, and the bar and
   restaurant are something to behold (and the food and drink are
   outstanding). Yes, it's on the outskirts of town, but with Uber, tram,
   and, if you so desire, a Lime scooter, you have no excuse not to stay
   here. (Website)

   Julien

   The OG Antwerp boutique hotel, and a sister property to August, it
   hasn't lost a step in all the years of its existence. Beautiful in and
   out. (Website)

   Maison Nationale

   If you don't need a full hotel setup and want a place to yourself, look
   no further than Maison Nationale Suites. These several self-service
   apartments are beautifully designed and are located right across MoMu.

The StyleZeitgeist Guide to Antwerp : 2025 Edition

   By Eugene Rabkin Features/Op-Ed, Travel Feb 20, 2025
   Tags: Antwerptravel guide

   It is hard to believe that we have not updated our Antwerp guide since
   2013, what with it being one of my favorite cities in Europe. What
   keeps pulling me back to this city, besides professional obligations?
   Fashion, obviously, as well as a mix of medieval and contemporary
   architecture, with some Art Nouveau buildings thrown in for good
   measure, in a place that can be traversed in one long walk. Antwerp has
   a sense of the quiet and the unpretentious mixed with the cosmopolitan.
   Design is in Antwerp's blood, and it punches way above its weight. It
   is also one of the few cities that is spared the waves of mass tourism.

   Antwerp changes constantly. Since my first visit in 2001, when I
   stuffed my backpack into a locker at the stunning Antwerp Central
   Station just to go shop, many designers have gone out of business, and
   their shops closed. I still miss the Veronique Branquinho shop, with
   its VB door handle that is still there, and the Walter Van Beirendonck
   shop with its amazing circular cash wrap suspended from the ceiling and
   manned by his aunt. But new stores have opened in their stead and the
   city is ever vibrant and never ceases to surprise.

   And so, without further ado is a list of my favorite places. As I
   mentioned, Antwerp is small - hence, I am not subdividing it into walks
   or organizing by neighborhoods as I do with larger cities.


   /SEE

   For its size, Antwerp has no shortage of wonderful museums and
   cathedrals.

   MOMU FASHION MUSEUM

   De Kathedraal

   Antwerp's main cathedral is a wonder to behold, as are the two main
   squares around it. The hefty 12 euro admission does get you a chance to
   look at four Paul Rubens paintings, two of which were painted
   specifically for the cathedral. (Website)

   Museum Plantin-Moretus

   This stunningly preserved 16th Century printing house is my favorite
   museum in Antwerp and the city's best-kept secret. Tucked away in a
   small square in the center of town, this jewel of preservation, with
   intact machines and various printing implements, provides a total look
   into how a printing house operated centuries ago. The living quarters
   are also well-preserved and its collection of books and graphics is
   formidable. (Website)

   MoMu

   Around the corner from Plantin-Moretus is MoMu, Antwerp's renowned
   fashion museum that puts on some of the best fashion exhibits in the
   world. Naturally, the focus is often on Belgian designers, which is not
   a complaint but a compliment, but it also happily expands beyond its
   homeland confines. (Website)

   KMSKA

   The Royal Museum of Fine Arts reopened in 2022 after a 100 million euro
   renovation that took eleven years. That's a lot of time and a lot of
   money, which brought back one of the grand institutions of Flemish art
   that is well worth visiting. All of the grand Flemish masters are
   well-represented here, as you might expect. (Website)

   M HKA

   Antwerp is not all about Flemish masters - after all, some of the best
   contemporary artists, such as Luc Tuymans, Berlinde De Bruyckere, and
   Michael Borremans, hail from the Flemish region - and this museum of
   contemporary art is there to remind you of this fact.

   Kloosterstraat

   If antiques is your cup of tea you will be in heaven in Kloosterstraat,
   which is regularly raided by antiques dealers and interior designers
   from London and Paris who then resell the stuff for double the price.
   Kloosterstraat is where the antique shops are concentrated, and since I
   can never remember their names, I advise you to simply walk up and down
   the street.

   Zurenborg

   Some time at the beginning of the 20th Century, the story goes, a
   visionary developer bought a large parcel of land in Antwerp's suburb
   of Berchem and told a bunch of architects to go to town. The result is
   several blocks of absolutely stunning buildings in the Art Nouveau,
   Gothic Revival, Tudor, and other fin-de-siecle styles. If this
   neighborhood was in any major city, it would be mobbed with tourists.
   Here, you will have it all to yourself. I cannot stress enough that
   this is not to be missed, even if it's away from the town center.


   /SHOP

   For the city of its size, the amount and level of shopping in Antwerp,
   from antiques and vintage to high-end, almost makes no sense. But it is
   a rich town with taste, and local spending power is buttressed by the
   influx of moneyed Dutch tourists.

   Jan Jan and Pietro pick up on their extensive travels in less traveled
   parts of the world. (Website)

   Kievit / Daniel Andresen

   The German, Antwerp-based knitwear master Daniel Andresen took over a
   disused apothecary in the North-East part of Antwerp a few years ago to
   open his own store, Kievit. It is a splendid space, and Andresen's
   knitting atelier is right behind it, a total farm-to-table model.
   (Website)

   Garden

   This newcomer to Antwerp's burgeoning retail scene is well-stocked with
   avant-garde brands such as Elena Dawson, John Alexander Skelton, and
   Archivio J.M. Ribot. The 19th Century white-washed, marble-accented
   space is grand and inviting and the staff are both knowledgeable and
   welcoming. (Website)

   Graanmarkt 13

   This Antwerp mainstay occupies an entire townhouse in the city center.
   The building was reworked by Vincent Van Duysen, my favorite architect,
   also Antwerp-based. It was one of the earliest stockists for Auralee,
   and has a nice selection of my favorite Belgian object-maker, Michael
   Verheyden, as well as Santa Maria Novella skincare. (Website)

   Houben

   Houben is one of those stores that can only be found in smaller cities.
   They are quirky, they cater to the loyal local clientele, they couldn't
   care less about e-commerce and they will have top tier brands that
   rarely wholesale. When I first encountered it in 2008, it was quietly

   accommodations. Remember, design is in the city's blood!

   AUGUST HOTEL

   August

   This is possibly my most favorite hotel in the world. I once told
   Vincent Van Duysen, who designed it, that it was made for me. The rooms
   are absolutely gorgeous in all of their muted glory, and the bar and
   restaurant are something to behold (and the food and drink are
   outstanding). Yes, it's on the outskirts of town, but with Uber, tram,
   and, if you so desire, a Lime scooter, you have no excuse not to stay
   here. (Website)

   Julien

   The OG Antwerp boutique hotel, and a sister property to August, it
   hasn't lost a step in all the years of its existence. Beautiful in and
   out. (Website)

   Maison Nationale

   If you don't need a full hotel setup and want a place to yourself, look
   no further than Maison Nationale Suites. These several self-service
   apartments are beautifully designed and are located right across MoMu.

About / Policies

   ABOUT:
   I came to fashion through music. As a teenager, I learned through
   watching music videos that what my favorite musicians wore went
   together with their sounds and words. For the first time it clicked in
   me that clothing can be a medium of expression. I began being attracted
   to fashion designers, such as Ann Demeulemeester, Raf Simons, and
   Undercover, who clearly thought the same. I started StyleZeitgeist in
   2006 in order to find like-minded people, and I've found many.

   Over the years StyleZeitgeist became a destination for individuals who
   are passionate about fashion design and its relationship with the rest
   of culture. We aim to cut through the noise and hype that surrounds
   much of fashion today. If fashion is culture, StyleZeitgeist is
   counterculture.

   Op-Ed: It's Time for Governments to Regulate Fast Fashion Comments Feed
   JSON oEmbed (JSON) oEmbed (XML)

   Over the past twenty years fast fashion has spurred unbridled
   consumerism, with disastrous consequences for the environment and human
   rights. In this time period, companies like Sweden's H&M and Spain's
   Zara have gone from middle-size purveyors of inexpensive clothing to
   juggernauts that operate thousands of stores across the world. In the
   last ten years they have been joined by new entrants such as UK's
   BooHoo, America's Fashion Nova, and most notably the Chinese giant
   Shein, which has undergone explosive growth in the past few years. All
   efforts to stop them have failed. It is now time for governments to
   step in and regulate fast fashion the way it has regulated Big Tobacco
   and the automotive industry.

   By pumping out vast amounts of clothing in countries where labor laws
   are lightly regulated, fast fashion companies have become some of the
   worst offenders when it comes to sustainability and ethical labor
   practices. Shein is a particularly egregious example because its
   operations are centered in China, which allows it to keep its
   manufacturing practices completely opaque and away from the eyes of
   Western regulatory agencies.

   Meanwhile, on the consumer end, the amount of textile waste generated
   by the developed world has reached truly staggering amounts. According
   to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, in 2018 Americans
   discarded 17 million tons of textiles, most of which came in the form
   of trashed garments.

   Much hand-wringing has been done to lament this sad state of affairs,
   and much blame has been put on the companies themselves. Fast fashion
   firms have enabled the shift in consumer mentality that has turned
   clothes-shopping into an addictive form of entertainment, making
   disposability the norm. Some of the blame should also fall on fast
   fashion consumers who treat shopping as a competitive sport, buying and
   discarding clothes at a historically unprecedented rate. According to a
   2019 report by the UN Alliance for Sustainable Fashion, "The average
   consumer buys 60 percent more pieces of clothing than 15 years ago.
   Each item is only kept for half as long."

   To be sure, the rest of the fashion industry bears some of the blame,
   but fast fashion, with its ultra-low prices and ultra-fast product
   churn, has been particularly egregious in enabling irresponsible
   consumer behavior. According to a 2019 Business of Fashion / McKinsey
   report, "one in three young women in the UK consider clothes `old'
   after wearing them once or twice. One in seven consider it a fashion
   faux-pas to be photographed in an outfit twice."

   All this shopping has paid off handsomely for fast fashion giants. The
   revenue and valuations of these companies are staggering. Earlier this
   year, Shein recently raised $2 billion in a fresh round of financing.
   It is now considering going public, seeking a valuation of $90 billion.
   After only eight years in business, its annual revenue of $23 billion
   roughly matches that of H&M.

   The media and activists have long waged an unsuccessful campaign
   against fast fashion, and if there is one thing we have learned from
   this struggle is that asking businesses to reform and shaming consumers
   does not work. In response to accusations, fast fashion companies
   engage in greenwashing practices, such as opening recycling centers and
   touting their use of organic cotton. Their customers also don't seem to
   care. By all accounts Gen-Zers are very concerned about climate change
   and ethical consumption, but numerous surveys also show that they are
   the biggest consumers of fast fashion.

   That public pressure has failed to curb the rampant rise of fast
   fashion is unsurprising. Companies are driven by the logic of
   capitalism that requires forever chasing revenue increases and
   cost-cutting. And consumers are driven by self-interest, which means
   maximizing the value of their spending. Fast fashion is especially
   well-positioned to do both by offering vast volumes of merchandise
   cheaply and by spurring customer demand through pervasive and
   persuasive marketing. Shein has been particularly savvy in employing
   armies of social media influencers and bots to whip up demand. YouTube
   and TikTok are flooded with videos of Shein hauls.

   If companies and consumers are not willing to reform, it falls on
   governments to step in and regulate this segment of the apparel
   industry. Some efforts have been made, such as the recent EU initiative
   that prevents companies from destroying clothing. But this is not
   enough. Fast fashion should be ultimately seen as a health and
   environmental hazard and regulated as such. It is time the governments,
   led by the developed world, do the following; tax fast fashion, demand
   and aggressively enforce greater business transparency, introduce
   manufacturing standards, and wage a public campaign about the dangers
   of fast fashion.

   Taxation should be used at all levels, from putting a higher VAT tax on
   fast fashion garments, the way it's been done for cigarettes, to taxing
   practices that contribute to global warming and pollution. Developed
   economic zones such as the US and the EU should start putting up
   greater tariff barriers and closing the existing loopholes that
   direct-to-consumer players like Shein take advantage of. Additionally,
   regulatory bodies should establish the framework of ethical labor
   practices that applies worldwide and not just in the West, and demand
   that the developing world manufacturers abide by these rules for fear
   of economic and political retaliation. Inspections of manufacturing
   sights should be done by international regulatory agencies and not be
   left up to the companies themselves, and fines for violations should be
   hefty.

   We also need a post-"Unsafe at Any Speed Moment," for the apparel
   industry. Just like Ralph Nader's blockbuster led to the US Congress to
   establish car safety standards, we need to establish durability
   standards for clothing. The European Union has already proposed such
   legislation, and the US should follow. Lastly, governments should
   heavily regulate, if not outright ban, fast fashion marketing, and also
   institute a campaign that educates the public on the dangers of fast
   fashion.

   The fight against Big Tobacco can provide much of the blueprint.
   Tobacco producers have been beaten through government intervention,
   which over time has also shifted cultural norms. In America, in 1964
   the Surgeon General officially recognized tobacco's health risks. A
   year later Congress required health warnings to be displayed on
   cigarette packs. In 1988 smoking was banned on most US flights. At the
   same time the US government sued the tobacco companies, taxed
   cigarettes heavily, and banned tobacco ads. It took decades, but the
   result is that smoking is now both expensive and uncool. It is time the
   governments across the world applied the same level of pressure to fast
   fashion.

   To be sure, this will be an uphill battle, because it will require
   reeducating the consumer not to act in one's own self-interest. Unlike
   tobacco, fast fashion does not pose self-evident health risks to
   consumers, and while we may feel sympathy for the children toiling in
   third world countries, these are not our children. It will be hard to
   shift society's perception about fast fashion and to wean the consumer
   off the habit of buying mountains of cheap clothes. But we are learning
   that this battle cannot be won by publishing articles targeting fast
   fashion companies or by showing videos of landfills and collapsed
   factory buildings in far away places. It can only be won at the policy
   level.

   StyleZeitgeist Academy is an independent education platform that offers
   courses for fashion enthusiasts, students, and professionals who want
   to study fashion at an academic level, in a structured yet engaging
   way, free from institutional bureaucracy and social-media chaos.

   Our courses provide a comprehensive overview of how contemporary
   fashion evolved, its key players, trends, cultural movements, and major
   sociopolitical events: through a mix of history and theory, students
   will learn not only what has happened in fashion industry, but discuss
   why it happened and how.

   The academy was founded by Eugene Rabkin, a former professor at Parsons
   the New School for Design, and an industry-recognized thought leader
   with fifteen years of writing experience. The idea for the academy
   arose from numerous conversations with fashion students and enthusiasts
   who have voiced the same complaint, that there is a lack of
   comprehensive framework for learning about fashion.

   Our courses are taught remotely to accommodate a global student body.
   The schedule is designed for full time students and employees. Each
   course is supported by a comprehensive online learning suite that
   contains all course materials, including books, articles, video, and
   audio.

   We keep our tuition fees on a manageable level by being laser-focused
   on education. StyleZeitgeist Academy does not issue diplomas -- we
   offer knowledge. Our goal is to build an informed discourse about
   fashion by continuously adding courses and faculty.

FAQ


   What is the format of your courses?

   The courses are taught via Zoom. A typical session consists of an
   hour-long lecture, assisted by a visual presentation, followed by a
   seminar, where students and instructor discuss the material. Some are
   semester-long, college-level courses. Others will be structured as
   shorter, master-class level courses. You will need a camera-equipped
   device, as we ask all students to be on camera to facilitate both
   lecture and discussion. Each class is supported by the Notion app,
   where each course is organized by sessions, with all supporting
   materials. We also run a Slack channel for additional discussion
   in-between classes.


   Are there prerequisites for taking a course?

   There are no academic prerequisites for taking our courses. We design
   them for people of various levels of education. Although we will
   sometimes tackle serious theory, it will be done in a guided manner. In
   the past we have had everyone from high school graduates to Ph.Ds in
   our courses. The only requirement is a fair understanding of spoken and
   written English (though you are free to read assigned books in your
   preferred language).


   What time zone are your courses in?

   Courses are often taught on weekends for fall and spring semester (more
   intensive in the summer semester) and begin at 12 p.m. EST (New York
   City) in order to accommodate the widest possible array of
   international students, from West Coast to continental Europe. If you
   live in Asia but are dedicated to learning, we welcome all night owls.


   What happens if I miss a session?

   A video recording of each lecture will be made available to you. The
   seminar parts are not recorded to protect student privacy. Please note,
   that although we've had students go through a semester solely relying
   on recordings due to a conflict in their schedule, we encourage
   everyone to be present for the discussion part.


   Do we get homework?

   There is reading homework for each class, as well as videos,
   documentaries, and podcast episodes. There is no written homework and
   no grading. Those who are interested in tutoring or mentoring can sign
   up for the Advanced study version of each class.


   What is advanced study?

   Advanced study offers you four one-on-one sessions with instructors,
   including further help with the course, consulting on personal and
   creative projects, writing and editing guidance, and brainstorming.


   Do you offer college credits?

   At this time we do not offer college credits or certificates.


   How can I pay tuition?

   We accept bank transfer or PayPal. Payments via PayPal are subject to a
   3% surcharge in order to recoup PayPal fees.

PARIS MENS FALL / WINTER 2025 SHOWROOM REPORT


   Last year I promised to lean into supporting smaller brands, and I have
   valiantly tried to visit as many showrooms as possible, so much so that
   I have not seen much of Paris this time. Each season I receive an
   avalanche of invitations, but I am just one person, so I am taking an
   opportunity to offer my apologies to those I was not able to visit. In
   general, many of the brands I've seen have stuck to their guns. This is
   fine, but it also does not provide much food for thought. Quite a few
   are struggling, but I hope that now that the so-called luxury is in
   tailspin, it's their time to come in and offer a superior product at a
   better price. There is certainly a contingent of men and women ready
   for it. And I see it as my job to connect these brands with a new
   audience. So, here it is.

   SONG FOR THE MUTE

   It's always nice to see a brand that started in the forum days of
   StyleZeitgeist becoming a resounding success noticed by the industry,
   as evidenced from its whimsical collaborations with Adidas Originals
   (another big collab is in the works, but I cannot say what it is).
   Though STFM has moved away from its SZ roots, it continues to put out
   thoughtful collections. This one, called Sunflower, had STFM's usual
   mix of lightness and substance. One of the ideas was to recreate a
   feeling of that rare vintage fine that one holds on to dearly, and I
   thought it worked well.

   A.PRESSE

   This new kid on the block in the long venerable line of Japanese
   menswear brands that fuse American workwear and Japanese craft has
   quickly made waves, and the level of obsession on the part of the
   menswear geeks when A.PRESSE is mentioned borders on mania. There is a
   reason for such a fervent reaction - in terms of quality of
   construction and finish it is IM.PRESSIVE. I love seeing such attention
   to quality channeled by a product brand rather than traditional luxury
   brand. All of A.PRESSE's fabrics come from Japan, except the sumptuous
   Spanish leathers. A particular favorite of mine was a silk / cotton
   collarless bomber jacket that was absolutely beautiful in its shape and
   feel. The leather jackets were also top notch, especially a trucker
   version.

   Nicolas Andreas Taralis

   I have not seen Nicolas in a long time due to my maddening Paris
   schedule, so it was lovely to catch up and see his collection in real
   life. NAT has been going high-end, which he sees as the only way to
   remain afloat as luxury goes mass market and continues to dilute its
   quality. Many of the garments he presented will be painstakingly
   produced at a small factory in Italy in editions of 15. The
   deconstructed tailoring he presented was especially brilliant, with
   unfinished fully canvased construction, and basting stitch left over
   that you can play with as you see fit. If I had any qualms is that some
   of the oversized garments were really humongous. I think we are about
   to start moving away from the cartoonish hugeness back to a silhouette
   that has a relationship with human anatomy, which I welcome.

   K'ANG

   This brand, from a former apprentice at m.a.+ and Deepti, has come on
   my radar last year and has become one of my most exciting finds. It is
   rare to see a young designer present a collection so accomplished. His
   tailoring is top notch and possesses a subtle edge, as evidenced in a
   black leather trench with metal buttons and an opening on the top of
   the back that gives it just the right amount of oomph. Add to it a
   matching helmet and you have an outfit that turns heads. Leave it out,
   and you have a garment that is calm and assured. One of the highlights
   of this collection were fabrics that went under a metal roller covered
   with eroding chemicals. Depending on the fabric, the effects were more
   or less subtle, but always cool. There was also a long deconstructed
   two-layer coat I have my eye on.

   THE VIRIDI-ANNE AND DEVOA

   Last year I reconnected with these two Japanese OG StyleZeitgeist
   stalwarts who show at the same showroom, so I am putting both under the
   same heading, even though the brands are different.

   The Viridi-Anne continues leaning into a tech direction, which makes
   sense for the techwear-obsessed Japan, but it's keeping things goth in
   its mostly black offerings. I liked the roomy jackets and pants that
   were on offer, as well as an adjustable carabiner belt.

   I was less convinced by Devoa, a brand I usually love. Its customary
   attention to construction was missing in favor of details that seemed
   superfluous. But I did love a part of the collection that was made with
   Faliero Sarti fabrics. For those who don't know, Faliero Sarti is a
   venerable Italian fabric house, which doubles as the unofficial
   supplier of scarves for the StyleZeitgeist universe.

   I'll add one last thing - it's gratifying to see brands like TVA and
   Devoa keep their pricing honest. Some of the wholesale prices seemed
   too good to be true. If you are looking to dress well and not spend
   stratospheric amounts of money, look to those two.

   LABEL UNDER CONSTRUCTION

   Another OG StyleZeitgeist brand has come back to Paris quietly with its
   excellent knitwear offering. These days Luca Laurini is keeping things
   simple, sticking to the tried and true not-so-basic knits he has built
   his brand on.

   SETCHU

   Satoshi Kuwata is a rare breed of a designer who deserves the
   mainstream attention he's been getting. He put on a show at Pitti Uomo,
   but it is the intimate, one-on-one experience with his thoughtful
   clothes that is the crux of what he does. Not only his fabrics are top
   notch, but his construction methods are brilliant in the way they give
   each garment transformative powers, therefore also giving the wearer
   more agency over the clothes. The new versions of his signature
   foldable origami blazers were feats of sartorial engineering, and even
   the simple sweatshirts with zippers running all through their sides
   were alluring.

   TAKAHIROMIYASHITATheSoloist.

   I was happy to see the brand back in Paris after a five-year hiatus.
   Although I've been able to follow TheSoloist closely, because I have
   either ended up in Japan at the time they were showing, or I would see
   a selection at their New York showroom, it was good to see the brand's
   complete offerings. For this collection, Takahiro Miyashita imagined a
   band, The Black and White Realism, and the color palette fitted the
   name. I particularly liked the fake fur lined bombers and extra-long
   coats whose long tails could be wrapped around one's legs. There was
   also a beautiful black kilt, a garment that I am particularly partial
   to.

   m.a.+ by Maurizio Amadei

   It's nice to see StyleZeitgeist brands slowly coming back to Paris, and
   m.a.+ was in top form here. The brand has built its uniform, on which
   it subtly iterates and adds to. This time its signature aviator jacket
   was updated in a beautiful stretchy fabric, and there were excellent
   long drape coats. Leather continues to be an indispensable part of the
   brand, and the boots, belts, and bags looked as desirable as ever.

   Forme d'Expression

   This brand has become my go to for relaxed tailoring for a reason -- it
   consistently hits it out of the park in terms of both the beauty of its
   fabrics and in the forgiving yet streamlined fit it offers. There was a
   new variation of a long coat with two horizontally aligned buttons that
   made it look something in between a double-breasted and a
   single-breasted construction, and another long "priest" coat. I've been
   a 3/4, Edwardian fit diehard for years, but lately I've been attracted
   to longer volumes and these were absolutely fantastic.

   SONO

   One of my recent discoveries, SONO has forged its own path by providing
   relaxed clothing made of brilliant natural fabrics, minimally died and
   made entirely in the UK, France, or Italy. They don't tout their
   sustainability credentials, but everything they do comes as close to
   responsible production as possible. But the clothes are the point,
   sweaters in cushy wools, relaxed coats, and drawstring pants are
   seductive in their deceptive simplicity; this is the stuff you want to
   live in.

   JAN JAN VAN ESSCHE

   There was not much deviation in this JJVE collection in terms of
   shapes, but his work with Japanese fabrics continue to inspire quiet
   awe. In addition to those, Jan Jan has spent some time last year among
   Indian artisanal weavers and what he brought back was amazing; lovely
   linens made without a single watt of electricity used that in their
   unevenness bore the imprints of a human hand.

   STOVAIGH

   This Chinese brand was a new discovery. In its oversized tailoring it
   offers loosely defined Southeast Asian tradition filtered through a
   contemporary lens. The palette is earthy and the fabrics are developed
   in Japan from yarn to cloth specifically for the brand, and are dyed by
   artisans using whatever organic materials they happen to gather, from
   tea to flowers. Some of the buttons are made by a Chinese ceramic
   artisan, and they are small treasures in themselves. I think this brand
   will be a worthy addition to my future Paris trips.

   EMATYTE

   This shoemaker was my last but not least stop on the artisan express.
   Gabriele makes shoes, boots, and sneakers by hand himself from start to
   finish in his workshop in Tuscany. Their construction, including
   Goodyear and Norwegian welts, is top notch, and his aesthetic is lived
   in. I like that there are artisans out there that offer completely
   handmade product that stands outside of the usual polished #menswear
   set. EMATYTE is a testament to the fact that tradition need not be
   conservative.

   PARATRAIT

   My last showroom stop was one of Tokyo Fashion Award, an organization
   that supports young Japanese talent. It's always worth a stop to see
   whom they are championing, and this time I liked a newcomer called
   Paratrait. Just when you think that the country that has birthed
   Snowpeak, Nanamica, Daiwa Pier 39, And Wander, Descente (I can go on
   and on) cannot possibly produce a new take on techwear, Paratrait's mix
   of tech and fashion proves otherwise. I was particularly taken by long
   black parkas that were weatherproof but did not look so. A+.

PARIS MENS FALL / WINTER 2025 SHOWROOM REPORT

   By Eugene Rabkin Fashion, Features/Op-Ed Jan 30, 2025

          TAKAHIROMIYASHITATheSoloist.

          JAN JAN VAN ESSCHE


   Last year I promised to lean into supporting smaller brands, and I have
   valiantly tried to visit as many showrooms as possible, so much so that
   I have not seen much of Paris this time. Each season I receive an
   avalanche of invitations, but I am just one person, so I am taking an
   opportunity to offer my apologies to those I was not able to visit. In
   general, many of the brands I've seen have stuck to their guns. This is
   fine, but it also does not provide much food for thought. Quite a few
   are struggling, but I hope that now that the so-called luxury is in
   tailspin, it's their time to come in and offer a superior product at a
   better price. There is certainly a contingent of men and women ready
   for it. And I see it as my job to connect these brands with a new
   audience. So, here it is.

   SONG FOR THE MUTE

   It's always nice to see a brand that started in the forum days of
   StyleZeitgeist becoming a resounding success noticed by the industry,
   as evidenced from its whimsical collaborations with Adidas Originals
   (another big collab is in the works, but I cannot say what it is).
   Though STFM has moved away from its SZ roots, it continues to put out
   thoughtful collections. This one, called Sunflower, had STFM's usual
   mix of lightness and substance. One of the ideas was to recreate a
   feeling of that rare vintage fine that one holds on to dearly, and I
   thought it worked well.

   A.PRESSE

   This new kid on the block in the long venerable line of Japanese
   menswear brands that fuse American workwear and Japanese craft has
   quickly made waves, and the level of obsession on the part of the
   menswear geeks when A.PRESSE is mentioned borders on mania. There is a
   reason for such a fervent reaction - in terms of quality of
   construction and finish it is IM.PRESSIVE. I love seeing such attention
   to quality channeled by a product brand rather than traditional luxury
   brand. All of A.PRESSE's fabrics come from Japan, except the sumptuous
   Spanish leathers. A particular favorite of mine was a silk / cotton
   collarless bomber jacket that was absolutely beautiful in its shape and
   feel. The leather jackets were also top notch, especially a trucker
   version.

   Nicolas Andreas Taralis

   I have not seen Nicolas in a long time due to my maddening Paris
   schedule, so it was lovely to catch up and see his collection in real
   life. NAT has been going high-end, which he sees as the only way to
   remain afloat as luxury goes mass market and continues to dilute its
   quality. Many of the garments he presented will be painstakingly
   produced at a small factory in Italy in editions of 15. The
   deconstructed tailoring he presented was especially brilliant, with
   unfinished fully canvased construction, and basting stitch left over
   that you can play with as you see fit. If I had any qualms is that some
   of the oversized garments were really humongous. I think we are about
   to start moving away from the cartoonish hugeness back to a silhouette
   that has a relationship with human anatomy, which I welcome.

   K'ANG

   This brand, from a former apprentice at m.a.+ and Deepti, has come on
   my radar last year and has become one of my most exciting finds. It is
   rare to see a young designer present a collection so accomplished. His
   tailoring is top notch and possesses a subtle edge, as evidenced in a
   black leather trench with metal buttons and an opening on the top of
   the back that gives it just the right amount of oomph. Add to it a
   matching helmet and you have an outfit that turns heads. Leave it out,
   and you have a garment that is calm and assured. One of the highlights
   of this collection were fabrics that went under a metal roller covered
   with eroding chemicals. Depending on the fabric, the effects were more
   or less subtle, but always cool. There was also a long deconstructed
   two-layer coat I have my eye on.

   THE VIRIDI-ANNE AND DEVOA

   Last year I reconnected with these two Japanese OG StyleZeitgeist
   stalwarts who show at the same showroom, so I am putting both under the
   same heading, even though the brands are different.

   The Viridi-Anne continues leaning into a tech direction, which makes
   sense for the techwear-obsessed Japan, but it's keeping things goth in
   its mostly black offerings. I liked the roomy jackets and pants that
   were on offer, as well as an adjustable carabiner belt.

   I was less convinced by Devoa, a brand I usually love. Its customary
   attention to construction was missing in favor of details that seemed
   superfluous. But I did love a part of the collection that was made with
   Faliero Sarti fabrics. For those who don't know, Faliero Sarti is a
   venerable Italian fabric house, which doubles as the unofficial
   supplier of scarves for the StyleZeitgeist universe.

   I'll add one last thing - it's gratifying to see brands like TVA and
   Devoa keep their pricing honest. Some of the wholesale prices seemed
   too good to be true. If you are looking to dress well and not spend
   stratospheric amounts of money, look to those two.

   LABEL UNDER CONSTRUCTION

   Another OG StyleZeitgeist brand has come back to Paris quietly with its
   excellent knitwear offering. These days Luca Laurini is keeping things
   simple, sticking to the tried and true not-so-basic knits he has built
   his brand on.

   SETCHU

   Satoshi Kuwata is a rare breed of a designer who deserves the
   mainstream attention he's been getting. He put on a show at Pitti Uomo,
   but it is the intimate, one-on-one experience with his thoughtful
   clothes that is the crux of what he does. Not only his fabrics are top
   notch, but his construction methods are brilliant in the way they give
   each garment transformative powers, therefore also giving the wearer
   more agency over the clothes. The new versions of his signature
   foldable origami blazers were feats of sartorial engineering, and even
   the simple sweatshirts with zippers running all through their sides
   were alluring.

   TAKAHIROMIYASHITATheSoloist.

   I was happy to see the brand back in Paris after a five-year hiatus.
   Although I've been able to follow TheSoloist closely, because I have
   either ended up in Japan at the time they were showing, or I would see
   a selection at their New York showroom, it was good to see the brand's
   complete offerings. For this collection, Takahiro Miyashita imagined a
   band, The Black and White Realism, and the color palette fitted the
   name. I particularly liked the fake fur lined bombers and extra-long
   coats whose long tails could be wrapped around one's legs. There was
   also a beautiful black kilt, a garment that I am particularly partial
   to.

   m.a.+ by Maurizio Amadei

   It's nice to see StyleZeitgeist brands slowly coming back to Paris, and
   m.a.+ was in top form here. The brand has built its uniform, on which
   it subtly iterates and adds to. This time its signature aviator jacket
   was updated in a beautiful stretchy fabric, and there were excellent
   long drape coats. Leather continues to be an indispensable part of the
   brand, and the boots, belts, and bags looked as desirable as ever.

   Forme d'Expression

   This brand has become my go to for relaxed tailoring for a reason -- it
   consistently hits it out of the park in terms of both the beauty of its
   fabrics and in the forgiving yet streamlined fit it offers. There was a
   new variation of a long coat with two horizontally aligned buttons that
   made it look something in between a double-breasted and a
   single-breasted construction, and another long "priest" coat. I've been
   a 3/4, Edwardian fit diehard for years, but lately I've been attracted
   to longer volumes and these were absolutely fantastic.

   SONO

   One of my recent discoveries, SONO has forged its own path by providing
   relaxed clothing made of brilliant natural fabrics, minimally died and
   made entirely in the UK, France, or Italy. They don't tout their
   sustainability credentials, but everything they do comes as close to
   responsible production as possible. But the clothes are the point,
   sweaters in cushy wools, relaxed coats, and drawstring pants are
   seductive in their deceptive simplicity; this is the stuff you want to
   live in.

   JAN JAN VAN ESSCHE

   There was not much deviation in this JJVE collection in terms of
   shapes, but his work with Japanese fabrics continue to inspire quiet
   awe. In addition to those, Jan Jan has spent some time last year among
   Indian artisanal weavers and what he brought back was amazing; lovely
   linens made without a single watt of electricity used that in their
   unevenness bore the imprints of a human hand.

   STOVAIGH

   This Chinese brand was a new discovery. In its oversized tailoring it
   offers loosely defined Southeast Asian tradition filtered through a
   contemporary lens. The palette is earthy and the fabrics are developed
   in Japan from yarn to cloth specifically for the brand, and are dyed by
   artisans using whatever organic materials they happen to gather, from
   tea to flowers. Some of the buttons are made by a Chinese ceramic
   artisan, and they are small treasures in themselves. I think this brand
   will be a worthy addition to my future Paris trips.

   EMATYTE

   This shoemaker was my last but not least stop on the artisan express.
   Gabriele makes shoes, boots, and sneakers by hand himself from start to
   finish in his workshop in Tuscany. Their construction, including
   Goodyear and Norwegian welts, is top notch, and his aesthetic is lived
   in. I like that there are artisans out there that offer completely
   handmade product that stands outside of the usual polished #menswear
   set. EMATYTE is a testament to the fact that tradition need not be
   conservative.

   PARATRAIT

   My last showroom stop was one of Tokyo Fashion Award, an organization
   that supports young Japanese talent. It's always worth a stop to see
   whom they are championing, and this time I liked a newcomer called
   Paratrait. Just when you think that the country that has birthed
   Snowpeak, Nanamica, Daiwa Pier 39, And Wander, Descente (I can go on
   and on) cannot possibly produce a new take on techwear, Paratrait's mix
   of tech and fashion proves otherwise. I was particularly taken by long
   black parkas that were weatherproof but did not look so. A+.

EXPO JAN-JAN VAN ESSCHE - MOMU ANTWERP

   "Khayal" is an intimate exhibit of the Antwerp designer Jan-Jan Van
   Essche, currently on display at MoMu, the city's fashion museum. The
   installation takes over the ground floor space of the museum. It begins
   with Van Essche's calligraphy-based drawings that guide you into just
   one room, where the designer has created an installation highlighting
   ten key silhouettes that embody his work. The space unfolds gradually
   as you walk around a wooden construction resembling traditional
   Japanese architecture, with custom made mannequins that reflect the
   designer's earthy West-meets-East approach. The serenity of the space
   gradually takes over, reflecting the serenity of Van Essche's designs
   as reflected in the handmade natural fabrics, indigo dyes, and loose
   silhouettes. Van Essche has created his own world, conducive to
   contemplation and slowing down time, and by the end of your visit the
   world outside will fall away.

Duran Lantink's Appointment to Gaultier Proves That Contemporary Fashion Is a
Simulation

   (BUTTON)

   Today we woke up to the news that the up and coming designer Duran
   Lantink has been appointed as the creative director of Jean Paul
   Gaultier. This completes his recent victory lap that began with
   sweeping a handful of fashion prizes, including the Andam award and the
   LVMH prize.

   And while it is commendable that a young designer gets a crack at
   spearheading one of the most important brands in the history of
   contemporary fashion, it's also worth taking a fresh look at what he
   actually makes. The artifacts that can be called garments in his oeuvre
   are pretty forgettable - there is little innovation in terms of the
   silhouette, nor is there a very strong discernible aesthetic statement.
   Lantink is not without talent, but his true strength lies in making
   outlandish, sculpted outfits that look good on Instagram. The look from
   his last collection that was shared the most was not a garment at all,
   but a sculpted male bust, shown on a female model. Things like this are
   designed to go viral in that look-at-this-silly-thing way. They are
   fashion as memes.

   Memes, not clothes have been the main output of the fashion industry
   for the past ten years. It began with Demna's Vetements Snoop Dogg tees
   and Balenciaga hoodies with the Bernie Sanders logo flip, and continued
   with Jacquemus's tiny bags and Ludovic de Saint Sernin's little bath
   towels as men's skirts. Fashion shows are now retooled to be made
   solely for Instagram, as in Coperni's spray dress stunt or its Paris
   Disneyland runway presentation.

   What's missing from these brands are actual designed clothes. Go into
   any Balenciaga shop and you will be treated to a parade of banal
   hoodies, jeans, and sneakers, with not a single item without a logo of
   some sort. Jacquemus is a laughing stock among those who actually know
   how clothes are made for his shoddy construction. De Saint Sernin's and
   Coperni's actual garments are not even worth the few extra keystrokes
   of my keyboard.

   In the theatrics these meme brands put on they are following the
   fashion greats such as Alexander McQueen, Thierry Mugler, and Jean Paul
   Gaultier himself. But there is one crucial difference - the spectacles
   that those designers have put on were not for the sake of the spectacle
   itself. They were in the service of pushing the boundaries of fashion
   and revolting against the fashion bourgeois establishment by presenting
   alternative visions of beauty. Oh, and they made clothes. Well made,
   beautifully designed garments meant for a three-dimensional world. What
   we are treated to today is a simulacrum. Fashion now is hyperreality,
   in which the real has been replaced by a collection of empty signs and
   symbols that replace reality itself. Real, three-dimensional life with
   genuine culture does not matter; what matters is how you look on social
   media and virality.

   McQueen once famously told a BBC reporter, "I don't want to do a show
   where you come out feeling like you just had Sunday lunch. I want you
   to come out either repulsed or exhilarated, as long as it's an emotion.
   If you don't feel an emotion, I'm not doing my job." What we get now
   with one viral moment on top of another is Sunday lunch. The primary
   emotion that fashion memes elicit are amusement. They are junk food,
   easily digestible and forgotten. And because they are easily digestible
   they require constant replenishment to keep our attention on the brand.
   Hence the proliferation of fashion memes - Balenciaga's bag that looks
   like a coffee cup, the J.W. Anderson bag that looks like a pigeon, one
   from Louis Vuitton that looks like a can of paint, Bottega Veneta's
   $10,000 leather flowers, a cotton Prada tank top that costs $1,000. No
   one expects to buy the latter two, they are designed to go viral with
   the price itself becoming an absurdist meme. The countless collabs,
   like Balenciaga x Erewhon or Balmain x Evian are memes. The clothes
   themselves don't matter - they are just merch with zero design value.

   And the sad thing is that it works. Hyperreality is more real to
   fashion than reality. Memes are more important than clothes, because
   they keep customers coming through the door. And the utmost purveyors
   of hyperreality get plum jobs - Demna is going to Gucci and J.W.
   Anderson to Dior. The cost of hyperreality to fashion is real. By now
   fashion has taught an entire generation of young designers and design
   students to make memes not clothes, to make not fashion shows but viral
   stunts, to live in a simulation and not reality. Lantink's appointment
   is just the latest proof that this strategy works. The idea today is to
   start a viral brand and hope that you will get attention and eventually
   a major appointment. Of course we know that often such appointments
   don't last. But it works for a while, until consumers realize that they
   have been duped, that there is no there there, and that reality matters
   and a simulacrum is just not enough.

Duran Lantink's Appointment to Gaultier Proves That Contemporary Fashion Is a
Simulation

   By Eugene Rabkin Fashion Apr 15, 2025

   Today we woke up to the news that the up and coming designer Duran
   Lantink has been appointed as the creative director of Jean Paul
   Gaultier. This completes his recent victory lap that began with
   sweeping a handful of fashion prizes, including the Andam award and the
   LVMH prize.

   And while it is commendable that a young designer gets a crack at
   spearheading one of the most important brands in the history of
   contemporary fashion, it's also worth taking a fresh look at what he
   actually makes. The artifacts that can be called garments in his oeuvre
   are pretty forgettable - there is little innovation in terms of the
   silhouette, nor is there a very strong discernible aesthetic statement.
   Lantink is not without talent, but his true strength lies in making
   outlandish, sculpted outfits that look good on Instagram. The look from
   his last collection that was shared the most was not a garment at all,
   but a sculpted male bust, shown on a female model. Things like this are
   designed to go viral in that look-at-this-silly-thing way. They are
   fashion as memes.

   Memes, not clothes have been the main output of the fashion industry
   for the past ten years. It began with Demna's Vetements Snoop Dogg tees
   and Balenciaga hoodies with the Bernie Sanders logo flip, and continued
   with Jacquemus's tiny bags and Ludovic de Saint Sernin's little bath
   towels as men's skirts. Fashion shows are now retooled to be made
   solely for Instagram, as in Coperni's spray dress stunt or its Paris
   Disneyland runway presentation.

   What's missing from these brands are actual designed clothes. Go into
   any Balenciaga shop and you will be treated to a parade of banal
   hoodies, jeans, and sneakers, with not a single item without a logo of
   some sort. Jacquemus is a laughing stock among those who actually know
   how clothes are made for his shoddy construction. De Saint Sernin's and
   Coperni's actual garments are not even worth the few extra keystrokes
   of my keyboard.

   In the theatrics these meme brands put on they are following the
   fashion greats such as Alexander McQueen, Thierry Mugler, and Jean Paul
   Gaultier himself. But there is one crucial difference - the spectacles
   that those designers have put on were not for the sake of the spectacle
   itself. They were in the service of pushing the boundaries of fashion
   and revolting against the fashion bourgeois establishment by presenting
   alternative visions of beauty. Oh, and they made clothes. Well made,
   beautifully designed garments meant for a three-dimensional world. What
   we are treated to today is a simulacrum. Fashion now is hyperreality,
   in which the real has been replaced by a collection of empty signs and
   symbols that replace reality itself. Real, three-dimensional life with
   genuine culture does not matter; what matters is how you look on social
   media and virality.

   McQueen once famously told a BBC reporter, "I don't want to do a show
   where you come out feeling like you just had Sunday lunch. I want you
   to come out either repulsed or exhilarated, as long as it's an emotion.
   If you don't feel an emotion, I'm not doing my job." What we get now
   with one viral moment on top of another is Sunday lunch. The primary
   emotion that fashion memes elicit are amusement. They are junk food,
   easily digestible and forgotten. And because they are easily digestible
   they require constant replenishment to keep our attention on the brand.
   Hence the proliferation of fashion memes - Balenciaga's bag that looks
   like a coffee cup, the J.W. Anderson bag that looks like a pigeon, one
   from Louis Vuitton that looks like a can of paint, Bottega Veneta's
   $10,000 leather flowers, a cotton Prada tank top that costs $1,000. No
   one expects to buy the latter two, they are designed to go viral with
   the price itself becoming an absurdist meme. The countless collabs,
   like Balenciaga x Erewhon or Balmain x Evian are memes. The clothes
   themselves don't matter - they are just merch with zero design value.

   And the sad thing is that it works. Hyperreality is more real to
   fashion than reality. Memes are more important than clothes, because
   they keep customers coming through the door. And the utmost purveyors
   of hyperreality get plum jobs - Demna is going to Gucci and J.W.
   Anderson to Dior. The cost of hyperreality to fashion is real. By now
   fashion has taught an entire generation of young designers and design
   students to make memes not clothes, to make not fashion shows but viral
   stunts, to live in a simulation and not reality. Lantink's appointment
   is just the latest proof that this strategy works. The idea today is to
   start a viral brand and hope that you will get attention and eventually
   a major appointment. Of course we know that often such appointments
   don't last. But it works for a while, until consumers realize that they
   have been duped, that there is no there there, and that reality matters
   and a simulacrum is just not enough.

What Karl Marx Can Teach Us About the Current State of Fashion

   (BUTTON)

   There's something rotten in the state of fashion. The kingdom of dreams
   seems to no longer be capable of producing them. Instead it has swamped
   its subjects in the sea of overpriced premium mediocre stuff, causing
   fatigue and boredom. What does an umpteenth collab or a logoed tee mean
   today? Nothing.

   The effects and the superficial causes of this sad state of affairs are
   widely discussed, but deep, underlying ones are not. Perhaps that's
   because fashion by its nature is preoccupied with the surface. But
   there are theories that can help us see beyond the facade. I already
   described one, of conspicuous consumption, developed by Thorstein
   Veblen in 1899. But we can go back even further in time, thirty years
   before Veblen, to Karl Marx and his magnum opus, Das Kapital. Marx may
   seem like an unlikely candidate for describing the current state of
   fashion, but bear with me (there is a reason why I assign his theory at
   the StyleZeitgeist Academy).

   In the past thirty years Marx has suffered a curious fate, especially
   in the neoliberal America, where he is seen not as a serious
   philosopher, but as a fiendish revolutionary devil whose writings cause
   instant communist brain damage. This view, mostly propagated by those
   who have never read Marx, has been so successful that Marx is virtually
   absent even from American so-called liberal academia. But Marx is a
   serious philosopher, who has not only accurately described some of our
   societal and economic conditions, but offered prescriptions that - it
   may shock you - have been incorporated into even the American society
   that only accepts the color red in its meat.

   But what does Marx's theory have to do with fashion? It helps to unpack
   one of central concepts of Das Kapital, exchange value versus use
   value. Marx's basic position is this: in the pre-capitalist economy,
   most things, including clothing, were produced by highly skilled
   artisans who were capable of crafting an object, let's say a coat, from
   start to finish, and were also likely to sell the product of their
   labor directly; which means that they fully identified with their labor
   and were invested into everything they made. By nature of their
   production, they could not make very much, and many things they made
   was quite expensive, which in turn limited the consumer's purchasing
   power. And so when the consumer did acquire an object, say the
   aforementioned coat, they would value it for its essential properties,
   such as protecting him from the elements, keeping him warm, and making
   him look presentable. Marx called this use value, the stuff that gave a
   coat its coatness, making that object real and concrete.

   Under the capitalist economy, Marx posited, such relationships
   disappear, or as he famously wrote, "all that is solid melts into air."
   Division of labor replaces a skilled craftsman with an assembly line
   worker who is charged with doing a repeated single task, who has
   neither the conception nor the ownership of the final product, which is
   sold by someone else half the way across the world. Instead of
   identifying with the final product, the worker is now alienated from
   it, and therefore is no longer invested in it as an artifact. Neither
   is the capitalist who sells it, because the product now becomes merely
   a commodity to be exchanged, meaning traded for money. Moreover, under
   the capitalist world order, where money becomes everything and where
   accumulation of objects becomes the most direct measure of one's
   self-worth, the consumer sees the product in the same way. We start
   valuing things for what they cost; their worth is measured not in terms
   of what an object does and how well it does it, but in monetary terms,
   in what it can be exchanged for. This is what Marx called exchange
   value.

   Marx posited that exchange value is abstract (what is money?), while
   use value is concrete (try walking around in the winter without a
   coat). Our prizing of abstract value leads to another of Marx's
   concepts, commodity fetishization, where we put commodities above
   ourselves because we value them for what they can be exchanged for, and
   not for their use.

   If this all seems too brainy, let's get concrete. Anyone who has tried
   to sell anything on Grailed will know exactly what Marx is talking
   about. By and large, the audience there only views garments in terms of
   exchange value, what it costs them, what the market is willing to pay,
   and so on. They are the epitome of the exchange value mindset that
   Oscar Wilde described so pithily in 1890, when he wrote, "Nowadays,
   people know the price of everything, and the value of nothing." People
   with the exchange value mindset don't alter their ill-fitting garments,
   because alteration may decrease their resale value. Most of the
   streetwear market, with its artificial scarcity and flip mindset, is
   the epitome of exchange value. Hype is exchange value. Limited edition
   is exchange value. "Collecting" has become an alibi for exchange value.

   Let's go further. What is a $600 t-shirt with a logo on it if not an
   example of a commodity as an abstraction? Its use value is next to
   zero. Additional use value can be derived from superior craftsmanship
   of an object, but an expensive t-shirt offers none. What is valued in
   such a garment is the purely abstract - the logo it carries and the
   price itself. This is commodity fetishization.

   Now zoom out and extrapolate that t-shirt mindset to all of fashion,
   and you can easily see that the fashion consumer is exhausted by
   decades of being forced to value fashion in purely abstract terms.
   We've gone through decades and decades of quality dilution, which has
   diminished use value, to be replaced by the logo as the marker of
   exchange value. The purely commercial run-of-the-mill commodities, like
   those t-shirts, that were once shoved into the showrooms for department
   store buyers are now on the runway. Fashion has turned to the logos and
   to collabs for empty value creation. And its consumers are now drowning
   in abstraction. But abstraction is like junk food; you feel good while
   you gorge on it and then you don't. And so finally, with fashion
   enthusiasts first and foremost, they have come to the inevitable
   conclusion that there is no there there, and no amount of creative
   director musical chairs or celebrity endorsements will get us out of
   this malaise.

   There is only one solution, for consumers to rediscover use value and
   for producers to give them garments they can be excited about. We need
   something concrete. The designer who understood this best was Martin
   Margiela. His work was about the garment, first and foremost. In his
   quest for prioritizing the garment, he made an all-white label that was
   attached to a garment by four stitches, so it could be easily removed.
   But the exchange value driven consumer did no such thing, turning the
   garments into a fetish. By now Margiela has become a fetish unto
   himself. Going forward, we need to reevaluate this state of affairs.
   Karl Marx can help.

   seem like an unlikely candidate for describing the current state of
   fashion, but bear with me (there is a reason why I assign his theory at
   the StyleZeitgeist Academy).

   In the past thirty years Marx has suffered a curious fate, especially
   in the neoliberal America, where he is seen not as a serious
   philosopher, but as a fiendish revolutionary devil whose writings cause
   instant communist brain damage. This view, mostly propagated by those
   who have never read Marx, has been so successful that Marx is virtually
   absent even from American so-called liberal academia. But Marx is a
   serious philosopher, who has not only accurately described some of our
   societal and economic conditions, but offered prescriptions that - it
   may shock you - have been incorporated into even the American society
   that only accepts the color red in its meat.

   But what does Marx's theory have to do with fashion? It helps to unpack
   one of central concepts of Das Kapital, exchange value versus use
   value. Marx's basic position is this: in the pre-capitalist economy,
   most things, including clothing, were produced by highly skilled
   artisans who were capable of crafting an object, let's say a coat, from
   start to finish, and were also likely to sell the product of their
   labor directly; which means that they fully identified with their labor
   and were invested into everything they made. By nature of their
   production, they could not make very much, and many things they made
   was quite expensive, which in turn limited the consumer's purchasing
   power. And so when the consumer did acquire an object, say the
   aforementioned coat, they would value it for its essential properties,
   such as protecting him from the elements, keeping him warm, and making
   him look presentable. Marx called this use value, the stuff that gave a
   coat its coatness, making that object real and concrete.

   Under the capitalist economy, Marx posited, such relationships
   disappear, or as he famously wrote, "all that is solid melts into air."
   Division of labor replaces a skilled craftsman with an assembly line
   worker who is charged with doing a repeated single task, who has
   neither the conception nor the ownership of the final product, which is
   sold by someone else half the way across the world. Instead of
   identifying with the final product, the worker is now alienated from
   it, and therefore is no longer invested in it as an artifact. Neither
   is the capitalist who sells it, because the product now becomes merely
   a commodity to be exchanged, meaning traded for money. Moreover, under
   the capitalist world order, where money becomes everything and where
   accumulation of objects becomes the most direct measure of one's
   self-worth, the consumer sees the product in the same way. We start
   valuing things for what they cost; their worth is measured not in terms
   of what an object does and how well it does it, but in monetary terms,
   in what it can be exchanged for. This is what Marx called exchange
   value.

   Marx posited that exchange value is abstract (what is money?), while
   use value is concrete (try walking around in the winter without a
   coat). Our prizing of abstract value leads to another of Marx's
   concepts, commodity fetishization, where we put commodities above
   ourselves because we value them for what they can be exchanged for, and
   not for their use.

   If this all seems too brainy, let's get concrete. Anyone who has tried
   to sell anything on Grailed will know exactly what Marx is talking
   about. By and large, the audience there only views garments in terms of
   exchange value, what it costs them, what the market is willing to pay,
   and so on. They are the epitome of the exchange value mindset that
   Oscar Wilde described so pithily in 1890, when he wrote, "Nowadays,
   people know the price of everything, and the value of nothing." People
   with the exchange value mindset don't alter their ill-fitting garments,
   because alteration may decrease their resale value. Most of the
   streetwear market, with its artificial scarcity and flip mindset, is
   the epitome of exchange value. Hype is exchange value. Limited edition
   is exchange value. "Collecting" has become an alibi for exchange value.

   Let's go further. What is a $600 t-shirt with a logo on it if not an
   example of a commodity as an abstraction? Its use value is next to
   zero. Additional use value can be derived from superior craftsmanship
   of an object, but an expensive t-shirt offers none. What is valued in
   such a garment is the purely abstract - the logo it carries and the
   price itself. This is commodity fetishization.

   Now zoom out and extrapolate that t-shirt mindset to all of fashion,
   and you can easily see that the fashion consumer is exhausted by
   decades of being forced to value fashion in purely abstract terms.
   We've gone through decades and decades of quality dilution, which has
   diminished use value, to be replaced by the logo as the marker of
   exchange value. The purely commercial run-of-the-mill commodities, like
   those t-shirts, that were once shoved into the showrooms for department
   store buyers are now on the runway. Fashion has turned to the logos and
   to collabs for empty value creation. And its consumers are now drowning
   in abstraction. But abstraction is like junk food; you feel good while
   you gorge on it and then you don't. And so finally, with fashion
   enthusiasts first and foremost, they have come to the inevitable
   conclusion that there is no there there, and no amount of creative
   director musical chairs or celebrity endorsements will get us out of
   this malaise.

   There is only one solution, for consumers to rediscover use value and
   for producers to give them garments they can be excited about. We need
   something concrete. The designer who understood this best was Martin
   Margiela. His work was about the garment, first and foremost. In his
   quest for prioritizing the garment, he made an all-white label that was
   attached to a garment by four stitches, so it could be easily removed.
   But the exchange value driven consumer did no such thing, turning the
   garments into a fetish. By now Margiela has become a fetish unto
   himself. Going forward, we need to reevaluate this state of affairs.
   Karl Marx can help.

   Black dandyism which opens this Saturday at The Metropolitan Museum of
   Art in New York, presents a history of Black style through the lense of
   dandyism, emphasizing the importance of sartorial style to Black
   identity formation in the Atlantic diaspora and the ways Black
   designers have interpreted and reimaged this history. The exhibition
   aims to highlight the various styles one could employ in order to be
   identified as a dandy: from austere minimalism to hyper-colorful
   tailoring, from deconstructed denim to high tech sportswear, dispelling
   the stereotype of flamboyance being the only indicator of dandyism.</p>

   we woke up to the news that the up and coming designer Duran Lantink
   was appointed as the creative director of Jean Paul Gaultier. This
   completes his recent victory lap that began with sweeping a handful of
   fashion prizes, including the Andam award and the LVMH prize.</p>
   <p>And while it is commendable that a young designer gets a crack at
   spearheading one of the most important brands in the history of
   contemporary fashion, itâs also worth taking a fresh look at what he
   actually makes. The artifacts that can be called garments in his oeuvre
   are pretty forgettable â there is no innovation there in terms of the
   silhouette, nor is there a strong discerning aesthetic statement.
   Lantinkâs true strength lies in making outlandish, sculpted outfits
   that look good on Instagram. The look from his last collection that was
   shared the most was not a garment at all, but a sculpted male bust,
   worn on a female model. Things like this are designed to go viral in
   that look-at-this-silly-thing way. They are fashion as memes.</p>

   and suspend your justified knee-jerk reaction at mentioning Trump
   before you read on, as I had to do in order to write this article.</p>
   <p>There is much debate about the economic damage of Trump's harsh
   tariff policies. Even though most tariffs have been suspended for 90
   days, let's go ahead with the scenario in which they go into effect.
   Many outcomes are still hazy, but one thing is clear, they will likely
   decrease consumption, especially in America. And in the world of
   overconsumption, isn't that what so many of us who are concerned with
   sustainability want? The developed world, and the US especially, groans
   under the weight of cheap stuff that the current world economy,
   especially in Asia, overproduces, and that ends up in landfills. The
   cycle of planned obsolescence has sped up across the board, but
   especially in fashion, where we no longer talk about fast fashion from
   the likes of H&#038;M, but about ultra-fast-fashion from the likes of
   the Chinese giant Shein.</p> <p>The post <a

   https://www.stylezeitgeist.com/?p=65607 <p>Thereâs something rotten in
   the state of fashion. The kingdom of dreams seems to no longer be

Unpacking Kering's Earnings

   (BUTTON)

   Today, Kering, the luxury conglomerate that owns Gucci, Yves Saint
   Laurent, Balenciaga, and Bottega Veneta, among others, reported its
   first quarter earnings, and the picture of the luxury industry it
   paints is even more dire than many thought. Overall sales are down by
   14%, Gucci's sales for the first three months of 2025 are down by 25%,
   as Kering's biggest brand flounders in the wake of a creative director
   reshuffling. At Yves Saint Laurent, its second biggest brand, sales are
   down 9%. Frustratingly, Kering does not break out Balenciaga's
   earnings, as it lumps them into "Other Houses," which include McQueen,
   Brioni, and a handful of jewelry brands they own. But Kering dropped a
   couple of hints in its earnings report.

   Overall revenue for "other houses" was down 11%. At the same time
   Kering boasted that sales grew at Brioni and its jewelry brands. Which
   means that most likely revenue at Balenciaga and McQueen dropped by
   more than 11%. Balenciaga may be dead in the water, except for its
   bags, which the brand has been pushing hard through relentless
   advertising. he performance of Balenciaga's leather goods lines was
   very solid, against an ongoing drop in store traffic," the company
   said. This also confirms what I see in the street during Paris Fashion
   Week - Balenciaga bags aplenty, but no more logoed jersey and almost no
   sneakers. The oversized black silhouette still reigns supreme for many
   fashion kids, but it looks like much of it is vintage - an easy
   substitute to Balenciaga's offerings.

   Meanwhile, Sean McGirr's McQueen, which virtually no one seems to like,
   got exactly one sentence in the report, "Sales were down at McQueen."
   One could almost hear the brusque curtness of an imperious father who
   does not even deign to bestow criticism on a child he deems totally
   hopeless.

   Bottega Veneta once again offered a bright spot, with revenues up 4%.
   But with Matthieu Blazy defecting to Chanel, its future is now in
   question (though we at StyleZeitgeist root for Louise Trotter). Brioni,
   Kering's high end tailoring line also grew slightly, as well as
   Kering's eyewear and beauty division.

   Now, what does it all mean? The picture the report paints is one that
   we already know.
    1. Luxury fashion is a mass market phenomenon. According to a report
       cited in the Economist, two-thirds of the business comes from
       consumers who spend 2,000 euros or less per year. That equals a
       couple of Balenciaga t-shirts, a Gucci belt or a pair of loafers,
       and a fragrance. That market has now largely collapsed, squeezed by
       egregious price hikes, economic uncertainty, and the rising dupe
       culture. That customer will still make an occasional small splurge,
       as can be seen in Kering's strong eyewear and beauty business.
    2. The rich are fine. Only brands that cater to the 1%, like Hermes,
       Brunello Cucinelli and Loro Piana, are doing well. The strength at
       Brioni, one of the top suit makers in the world, confirms this.
    3. There are only four untouchable luxury brands (for various reasons)
       - Chanel (incredible DNA and brand equity), Dior (ditto), Hermes
       (pinnacle of luxury positioning), and Louis Vuitton (#1 mass market
       brand, gets first dibs at middle class wallets). Kering has none.
       LVMH has two, and that's why their luxury fashion sales are down
       only 5%.
    4. Creative directors matter. The age of the primacy of the brand over
       the creative director may not exactly be at an end, but a slew of
       lackluster appointments show that talent still matters, and that
       big brands cannot coast on marketing alone.
    5. This downturn is not only cyclical but structural. The luxury
       industry overall has lot a lot of credibility with its audience in
       the past couple of years through egregious price hikes and
       generally disdainful attitude, and it may take a long time to
       rebuild that trust. Consumer are turning to other things -
       vacations, dupes, concerts - to seek pleasure in.

   My prediction is that this is far from over. All the trends that
   started at the end of 2023 are holding. With the looming stagflation
   (recession + inflation), and more likely price hikes on the horizon,
   things are not going to get better. Except similar earnings for the
   rest of the year if not beyond.

Unpacking Kering's Earnings

   By Eugene Rabkin Fashion Apr 23, 2025

   Today, Kering, the luxury conglomerate that owns Gucci, Yves Saint
   Laurent, Balenciaga, and Bottega Veneta, among others, reported its
   first quarter earnings, and the picture of the luxury industry it
   paints is even more dire than many thought. Overall sales are down by
   14%, Gucci's sales for the first three months of 2025 are down by 25%,
   as Kering's biggest brand flounders in the wake of a creative director
   reshuffling. At Yves Saint Laurent, its second biggest brand, sales are
   down 9%. Frustratingly, Kering does not break out Balenciaga's
   earnings, as it lumps them into "Other Houses," which include McQueen,
   Brioni, and a handful of jewelry brands they own. But Kering dropped a
   couple of hints in its earnings report.

   Overall revenue for "other houses" was down 11%. At the same time
   Kering boasted that sales grew at Brioni and its jewelry brands. Which
   means that most likely revenue at Balenciaga and McQueen dropped by
   more than 11%. Balenciaga may be dead in the water, except for its
   bags, which the brand has been pushing hard through relentless
   advertising. he performance of Balenciaga's leather goods lines was
   very solid, against an ongoing drop in store traffic," the company
   said. This also confirms what I see in the street during Paris Fashion
   Week - Balenciaga bags aplenty, but no more logoed jersey and almost no
   sneakers. The oversized black silhouette still reigns supreme for many
   fashion kids, but it looks like much of it is vintage - an easy
   substitute to Balenciaga's offerings.

   Meanwhile, Sean McGirr's McQueen, which virtually no one seems to like,
   got exactly one sentence in the report, "Sales were down at McQueen."
   One could almost hear the brusque curtness of an imperious father who
   does not even deign to bestow criticism on a child he deems totally
   hopeless.

   Bottega Veneta once again offered a bright spot, with revenues up 4%.
   But with Matthieu Blazy defecting to Chanel, its future is now in
   question (though we at StyleZeitgeist root for Louise Trotter). Brioni,
   Kering's high end tailoring line also grew slightly, as well as
   Kering's eyewear and beauty division.

   Now, what does it all mean? The picture the report paints is one that
   we already know.
    1. Luxury fashion is a mass market phenomenon. According to a report
       cited in the Economist, two-thirds of the business comes from
       consumers who spend 2,000 euros or less per year. That equals a
       couple of Balenciaga t-shirts, a Gucci belt or a pair of loafers,
       and a fragrance. That market has now largely collapsed, squeezed by
       egregious price hikes, economic uncertainty, and the rising dupe
       culture. That customer will still make an occasional small splurge,
       as can be seen in Kering's strong eyewear and beauty business.
    2. The rich are fine. Only brands that cater to the 1%, like Hermes,
       Brunello Cucinelli and Loro Piana, are doing well. The strength at
       Brioni, one of the top suit makers in the world, confirms this.
    3. There are only four untouchable luxury brands (for various reasons)
       - Chanel (incredible DNA and brand equity), Dior (ditto), Hermes
       (pinnacle of luxury positioning), and Louis Vuitton (#1 mass market
       brand, gets first dibs at middle class wallets). Kering has none.
       LVMH has two, and that's why their luxury fashion sales are down
       only 5%.
    4. Creative directors matter. The age of the primacy of the brand over
       the creative director may not exactly be at an end, but a slew of
       lackluster appointments show that talent still matters, and that
       big brands cannot coast on marketing alone.
    5. This downturn is not only cyclical but structural. The luxury
       industry overall has lot a lot of credibility with its audience in
       the past couple of years through egregious price hikes and
       generally disdainful attitude, and it may take a long time to
       rebuild that trust. Consumer are turning to other things -
       vacations, dupes, concerts - to seek pleasure in.

   My prediction is that this is far from over. All the trends that
   started at the end of 2023 are holding. With the looming stagflation
   (recession + inflation), and more likely price hikes on the horizon,
   things are not going to get better. Except similar earnings for the
   rest of the year if not beyond.

The StyleZeitgeist Tokyo Guide: 2025 Edition

   By Eugene Rabkin Culture, Travel Feb 6, 2025

   ji Yamamoto

   Tokyo Ginza

   For the aesthetically inclined and design conscious there is probably
   no better place on earth than Tokyo. Things are similar enough and
   foreign enough in Tokyo to make it all the more exciting, even though
   in the last couple of years the intractable march of globalization of
   culture has left an indelible stamp on the city.  It's been seven years
   since this guide was originally published and the city undoubtedly
   feels more touristy. But it has lost almost none of its excitement or
   charm. Almost, because some areas, such as Harajuku, aren't really not
   worth your time anymore.

   I've been to Tokyo seven times and by now and there is still much to
   discover feel. Tokyo is different from Western cultural capitals - here
   it's not about grand architecture and museums but about the fabric of
   the city. Therefore, I decided that the best approach is to break the
   guide down by neighborhood rather than make a list of places, because
   there are too many of them. Tokyo is vast - don't even think about
   spending less than a week here. I'll list the neighborhoods more or
   less in order of preference and/or proximity to each other. Aside from
   these recommendations, the best advice I can give you is to get lost in
   the wonderful maze of Tokyo's streets - because the best spots are
   often in the back alleys off the main thoroughfares. You'll need your
   GPS. I will leave it to you to google the addresses on your own.

   Omotesando/Aoyama

   This is the place to shop. Most of the flagships of Japanese brands are
   concentrated in these adjacent neighborhoods. Within several blocks of
   each other you will see shops of Comme des Garcons, Yohji Yamamoto,
   Undercover, Sacai, Kolor, and TAKAHIROMIYASHITATheSoloist. But I'd
   start with the Nezu museum - its wonderful traditional Japanese garden
   is serenity itself, and will charge you for the onslaught of shopping.
   Next door to Nezu is the Rick Owens flagship, so you might as well
   start your shopping there. Then cross the street, go up the stairs to
   see the Grocery Store, which is actually The Soloist flagship. Adjacent
   to it are several small shops from Arts & Science, Sonya Park's
   mini-empire, which are worth a visit.

   Turn the corner and you'll encounter the Yohji Yamamoto shop and then
   Comme des Garçons (and Issey Miyake across the street). Then loop
   around the Prada building and sneak into the Undercover flagship. If
   you are into Sacai or Kolor, those are also nearby. Most likely you
   will be ready for a coffee by then, and you could do worse than get one
   at Blue Bottle Aoyama. Make your way back to the main thoroughfare and
   take a peek at Omotesando Hills. Yes, it's a mall, but it's a mall
   built by Tadao Ando. You don't need to spend a lot of time at
   Omotesando Hills, unless you want to get lunch there, although I really
   recommend the best branch of Maisen, Tokyo's tonkatsu temple (go off
   hours if you don't want to stand in a long line). Walk further and
   cross the main thoroughfare back by an overpass and make your way to
   the Gyre building, which has the Comme des Garcons Trading Museum the
   CDG Good Design Shop, and the Visvim flagship. If you are ready for a
   casual snack, you could grab some takoyaki - octopus balls - from a
   stand on Cat Street across from the Opening Ceremony building. If you
   have strength left you can check out the flagship of Graphpaper, the
   much hyped Japanese menswear brand, which also carries Lemaire and Aeta
   bags.

   If you get sick of looking at stores, you can make your way up to the
   Yoyogi park. Despite being mobbed by tourists, it's still a peaceful
   place. Check out the Meiji shrine, and than walk up and left to reach a
   pond, which is pretty and few tourists make it up there.

   Daikanyama / Nakameguro

   These two lovely neighborhoods are next to each other and a complete
   antidote to the two above. They are busy but not crowded and have a
   decidedly more village-like feel. Daikanyama is a posh area whose NYC
   equivalent is probably TriBeCa or West Village. You can start at
   T-Site, a sprawling branch of the bookstore chain Tsutaya. It carries a
   large selection of art and design books and seemingly every magazine
   under the sun. If your brain is about to explode because you are unable
   to choose which of the fifty Daido Moriyama books to buy, you can walk
   across the street and have a coffee on the back terrace of Saturday's
   Surf. However, if you need to decide between coffee or tea, what you
   really want is the downstairs tea salon at the Daikanyama branch of the
   Conran Shop. And the store itself is brilliant - a completely different
   concept from other branches, it is devoted solely to Japanese and Asian
   craft. It carries clothes and blankets from Mittan, Aeta bags, and su
   Ha wooden jewelry, among many other treasures.

   If you have time and want to make the effort, you can hunt down the
   well-hidden Daikanyama branch of Arts & Science. Otherwise, continue
   down the main drag until you come to The Address, which houses Lift
   Daikanyama. The store is beautiful and really gives justice to a large
   collection of Carol Christian Poell the shop carries, along with m.a.+,
   Label Under Construction and other artisanal brands.

   From Daikanyama you'll want to walk downhill to Nakameguro. If you are
   hungry by then and the weather is nice, make sure to stumble upon
   Carlino's pizza truck - the pizza is outstanding (say hi to Hisa for
   me). Nakameguro's main draw are the several peaceful, cherry tree-lined
   blocks by the Meguro river, which largely house independent shops,
   restaurants, and art galleries, as well as the little alleys behind
   them. You'll probably want to also walk into the Nakameguro branch of
   Aesop, one of its best. The newly opened Visvim flagship, spread over
   two adjacent buildings is absolutely beautiful, and it has a cafe with
   one table. If vintage repro is your style you may also want to hit up
   the Nigel Cabourn flagship. If you are looking for a nice hat, check
   out Nine Tailor. Another shop worth browsing is 1LDK, which also has a
   cafe that's a good option for lunch. Otherwise, I recommend Afuri for
   ramen. But if you want to stick to cafes, Epulor is a wonderful,
   vinyl-spinning all day spot that is equally good for a coffee in the
   afternoon or for a glass of wine in the evening.

   For dinner I wholeheartedly recommend one of my most favorite izakayas,
   Tatemichiya. The chef-owner is an old punk, and the interior is lined
   in punk and Japanese gangster movie posters. You will be hearing punk
   all evening. Kick back with a beer and skate wings that you'll have to
   grill yourself and which make a perfect beer snack, and get the divine
   steak.

   LEMAIRE EBISU

   Ebisu

   Adjacent to Daikanayma, Ebisu is primarily a residential neighborhood,
   but it has some great retail spots that make it worth a visit. Getting
   out of the Ebisu train station and walking up a hill will bring you to
   the trio of Kapital stores. From there, you can walk to the Yebisu
   Garden Place, which is a weird structure that resembles an Atlanta
   mall. But, it does have a Yebisu Beer cafe, and I recommend tasting a
   local brew. You can check out what's on view at the Tokyo Photographic
   Art Museum next to it, or you can continue walking past until you hit
   the newly opened Lemaire flagship. The beautiful space occupies a
   private house that was built in the '60s and Lemaire left the apartment
   atmosphere intact. Walk for another few minutes and around the corner
   there is The Viridi-Anne flagship with the most complete lineup of the
   brand's offerings. There is also a Hender Scheme store nearby, and last
   not but least there is Biotop, which is one of those multibrand
   neighborhood stores that are too out of the way for tourists and
   therefore cater to the local affluent, and in my opinion such shops are
   always fascinating. Biotop carries The Row, Auralee, and HYKE, amongst
   others. Weirdly enough, I don't have any must recommendations for food
   in Ebisu, unless you want to eat Afuri ramen again, but you should
   finish your night at Bar Martha, my favorite vinyl bar in Tokyo.

   Roppongi

   Roppongi gets a bad rep because a part of it is full of lame bars and
   banker expats, but there is a lovely part to it, whose epicenter is the
   Tokyo Midtown Tower. In the said tower the main draw are the interior
   design shops. If you are into Japanese ceramics, knives, and so on,
   this is the place, with stores like Time & Style, Hinobashi Kiya,
   Tenerita, and a small outpost of Itoya, the stationary emporium. And
   don't miss the Nakagawa Masashichi Shotengai kiosk on the ground floor
   - it's a great shop for small gifts. You will need to recharge your
   batteries before visiting the 21_21 Design Sight, an art gallery
   designed by Tadao Ando for Issey Miyake, so grab some dessert from
   Sadaharu Aoki, the Paris-trained Japanese patisserie maker, or a bento
   box from a slew of small stall and go out to the park in the back of
   Midtown Tower. You may also be tempted to walk into Barneys, but I
   don't recommend it. If you are in luck, the National Arts Center will
   have a good exhibit on. And if not, then make your way to the Mori Art
   Museum. It occupies a top floor of another complex whose plaza features
   a giant Louise Bourgeois spider, and which also includes a mall that
   has two Kapital outposts in it.

   Shibuya

   It's not that I hesitate to recommend Shibuya - it's such a Tokyo icon
   - but just know what you are getting into. It's a teenager and tourist
   mob, but you gotta do it once, preferably on a Tuesday. Go in the early
   evening, after the sun sets to experience the full effect of Shibuya's
   lights. Start at the Shibuya crossing, as you must, and slowly (you'll
   have no choice) make your way up. Breathe deeply and go with the flow
   and you'll be fine. If you are into vinyl or CDs, your can pop into a
   branch of Disk Union and its five floors of goodies. If not, stop by
   Loft to load up on Japanese stationary and other knick-knacks you never
   new you needed. It's also a one-stop shop for all the little gifts you
   may want to bring from Tokyo. Walk far up enough and you'll hit
   branches of Neighborhood and (W)Taps. Keep walking and you'll hit the
   huge flagship of Descente, one of my favorite Japanese outdoor brands.
   And from there, if you still have energy left, you can walk up Cat
   Street, which is full of high street stores, and eventually end up in
   Omotesando.

   JIL SANDER GINZA

   Ginza / Marunouchi

   Ginza is the Tokyo equivalent of Fifth Avenue. It's old glitz and
   glamour, and you should do it only if you have time. You will most
   likely start at Dover Street Market. No need to explain that one.
   Around the corner from DSM is the newis luxury mall called Ginza Six.
   Perhaps it's worth checking out for some interior design shops and its
   restaurants. There is also a branch of Undercover, etc. On its top
   floor there is a bar called Mixology Salon, which makes phenomenal
   tea-based cocktails. From Ginza Six walk a couple of blocks to the
   flagship of Itoya for seven stories of all things stationary. Further
   up you will find a well-hidden branch of Highashiya, a shop that is
   part of the Ogata empire. This is the place to hit up for sweets and
   tea for yourself and for your loved ones back home. From there you can
   either pop around the corner to see the new Jil Sander shop with a
   stunning interior by Casper, Mueller, Kneer, one of my favorite
   architects, or continue on to the Hermés building by Renzo Piano. You
   don't need to walk in, but cross the street and admire the stunning
   glass brick facade.

   If you can still walk, I am one of the few weird people who actually
   likes Marunouchi, an office neighborhood of glass towers. Walk up to
   the Tokyo Station, one of the few old European style buildings that
   have been immaculately preserved. If you are hungry, there is a myriad
   of food options inside. There is a ton of shopping in the glass towers
   adjacent to the Tokyo Station. My favorite is Shin Marunouchi, which
   has a branch of Beams, the Conran Shop, and a few other interesting
   things.

   Shinjuku

   If you want to do all of your shopping in one place, you could do worse
   than Isetan, which has pretty much everything under the sun. You'll
   want to strategize and only hit the floor that has Japanese designers,
   as well as the household floor, or you will exhaust yourself. Use the
   time and energy you saved and head straight for the basement food
   court, which is the eighth wonder of the world, right behind the
   pyramids of Giza. If the weather is nice, grab a bento box and head for
   the Shinjuku Gyoen, a lovely public garden, for a picnic (the $5 entry
   fee is well worth it). After you've fortified yourself you can go back
   where you started and hit up the Shinjuku branches of Disk Union and
   Beams, across from each other. You'll probably be exhausted by then, so
   I'm keeping the Shinjuku part short.

   Jimbocho

   If you are a book hound, this neighborhood is your heaven. Start at
   Komiyama, the multi floor emporium that has every fashion, art, and
   photo book you've ever wanted and couldn't find elsewhere. From there,
   loop around the corner, spot a beautiful concrete paneled building that
   houses Nanyodo, solely devoted to architecture books. The two-floor
   atrium space itself is a modernist architecture dream. Then make your
   way to Super Labo, a gallery / bookshop of one of the best photo book
   publishers in the world, whose selection of photographers as is high
   quality and tight as their paper, ink, and binding. If you have energy
   left, wonder around and you'll find more book shops, as well as another
   branch of Disk Union.

   Practical Info

   You will need Internet access at all times. If you cannot use the GPS
   on your phone, you will get lost - guaranteed.

   Use the subway. Unlike Tokyo's notoriously hard to navigate streets,
   the subway system is easy to master, has all signs in English, and is
   incredibly efficient. Buy a Suica or a Pasmo card, or get them on your
   smartphone wallet, and load money on it. Not only it's accepted by all
   Tokyo metro lines (which are run by different companies, which make
   buying one-time tickets even more annoying), but it serves as a de
   facto debit card that you can use at convenience stores, luggage
   lockers and more.

   Forget about finding the best ramen shop or a tonkatsu spot or a coffee
   shop. There are simply too many good ones, and you don't need to make
   the extra effort. If you need a telling sign that a place is good, it
   will probably be full and there will be a line to get in. Waiting in
   line for food is a thing in Japan, so get with the program.

   Learn how to say "thank you" in Japanese, and maybe a few other
   phrases. It will get you far. Contrary to popular belief not many
   Japanese speak English, though you will be more or less Ok in central
   Tokyo. If you need something, point. In many restaurants menus come
   with pictures. In general, be polite and for god's sake don't be loud
   and respect personal space. Don't talk on the phone on the subway and
   you are not allowed to smoke on the street.

StyleZeitgeist Podcast: NEMESIS with Emily Segal

   On this episode we speak with Emily Segal, the founder of the brand
   strategy agency Nemesis, publishing house Deluge, and the author of the
   novel Mercury Retrograde. Emily came to fame in the 2010s as the
   co-founder of the collective K-Hole, which coined the term "normcore."
   She went on to work with everyone from Prada to Supreme, and learned a
   few things along the way, some of which we discuss in this episode. We
   mostly concentrate on two pieces of her writing, the Umami Theory of
   Value and B for Balenciaga, a brand case study. We discuss why the
   current culture feels like a postmodernist, meaningless,
   made-for-Instagram slop, or as Emily writes, "Umami is what you got
   when you did not get anything," why Balenciaga is a cultural apex
   predator, a vortex that sucks in cultural artifacts and spits them out
   as memes, why Demna's irony is hollow, whether he will succeed at
   Gucci, and much more besides.

SHOP.CASE -- a.PRESSE

   By Editors Fashion Feb 12, 2025
   Tags: a.PRESSEshibuyaTokyo

   The shop of a.PRESSE, the Japanese brand that is currently making a lot
   of noise amongst menswear enthusiasts, is located in a nondescript
   concrete building in upper Jingumae, in Tokyo, a ten minute walk from
   the hubbub of the winding streets above Omotesando, which have been
   taken over by mainstream streetwear brands.

   But walk into the semi-basement space and that is where all the
   anonymity ends. The walls and columns are clad in a compound made of
   soil, straw, sand, and cement, giving them a texture somewhere between
   concrete and Venetian plaster. The furniture is a mix of mid-century
   Brazilian and Danish, and the speakers are vintage JBL. The brass
   clothes racks and even the oak wood hangers, are custom made for
   a.PRESSE. Such minute attention to detail adds warmth and makes the
   sparseness of the space an asset in itself.

   a.PRESSE, Tokyo, Shibuya, Jingumae, 2 Chome-5-4 B1F.

The StyleZeitgeist Guide to Paris: 2025 Edition

   Saint Chapelle by Matthew Reeves
   (BUTTON)

   On some level writing a guide to Paris is an exercise in futility. What
   can one write about a city where you can get a good glass of wine and a
   decent meal in so many places - as long as you stay away from the
   touristy areas - and where there is no such thing as the best bakery.
   Therefore, this guide to Paris is the guide to what I have gotten to
   know over the years of traveling to the City of Light.

   I've been to Paris about fifty times, I've walked it back and forth,
   and I know I am not nearly close to discovering all the goodies it has
   to offer and have not sufficiently explored all of its neighborhoods
   (for example, I rarely find myself in Montmartre, or in Charonne). I've
   not been to the 20th arrondissement, which is where the epicenter of
   hipsterdom has moved to. I have not yet been to the Catacombs (very
   ungoth of me), and I've never had any luck record shopping in Paris.

   Nevertheless, I think I have gotten a pretty good handle on the city,
   and I am happy to share it with you.

   EAT

   One of the best thing to do in Paris is eating simply. French produce
   will make you weep and want to move to Paris. The quality of produce is
   great, the meat is fantastic, the dairy divine, and the bread
   unparalleled. If weather allows, go to one of the farmers markets, like
   the one above Bastille or on Boulevard Raspail, buy a bunch of gorgeous
   vegetables, cheeses, pates, wine, and go to a park and devour it all.
   But if you can't, here are a bunch of restaurants for you. Be warned,
   quite a few are Japanese, since Paris has a serious love affair with
   Japanese cuisine.

   Bambino

   Loosely inspired by Tokyo's vinyl bars, this drinks and small plates
   spot is an open secret for a reason. Absolutely fantastic food and
   natural wines. Come at the opening on the dot or you will be waiting in
   line among the young and the hip.

   Brasserie du Louvre

   It is not easy to get a good meal this close to the Louvre because of
   all the tourist traps. But this classic from chef Paul Bocuse, located
   inside of Hotel de Louvre, delivers on all fronts, from the wine to the
   food to the service.

   Breizh Cafe

   One of the best creperies in Paris where you get real buckwheat
   galettes and not the tourist-aimed trash. The Marais location is always
   packed but the St. Germain one is quite chill. Be warned though, you'll
   be giving your money to Francois Pinault.

   Brutos

   The 11th has long been a stalwart of hipster innovative cuisine. There
   is a series number of good restaurants. Go to Brutos for the
   outstanding Sunday only whole roasted chicken lunch. Bring a friend and
   come hungry.

   Comptoir de la Mer, Comptoir de la Terre, L'Avant Comptoir

   This trio of counter-seating restaurants have turned one section of St.
   Germain into a glorious foodie haven. It's wine- and small
   plates-driven, so get a glass or a bottle and follow up with food. I'm
   partial to Comptoir de la Mer, because in Paris it's much easier to get
   good meat than seafood, but it's all outstanding.

   Cravan

   You don't have to look far for good wine in Paris, but a good cocktail
   is another matter. This is my favorite bar, and now they have opened
   one in St. Germain, so you don't have to schlep to the original in the
   16th, though if you can, do. And don't miss their snacks!
   Cravan

   Les Enfants Rouges

   This French-Japanese fusion tucked away in a small alley by the Enfants
   Rouges food market always delivers in terms of both the food and the
   atmosphere.

   French Paradox

   Never mind the silly name - this duck palace has the best confit du
   canard I've had in Paris. I mean, that's what you came to Paris for,
   right? It's situated in a lovely arcade right across from the - in my
   humble opinion - overrated Racines.

   L'As du Falafel

   Still the best falafel outside of Israel, although because of Instagram
   now you may have to wait forty minutes to get one. Pro tip - at this
   point it may be faster to join the much smaller line for eating inside.
   If you do takeaway, Places des Vosges is within walking distance.

   Le Petite Marché

   An excellent French restaurant in the heart of Marais but on a back
   street that makes you feel like you are in another neighborhood. Never
   not good.

   Le Petit Vendome

   It is hard to get an honest meal or an excellent sandwich near Place
   Vendome, whose poshness tends to make one choke on their food. Le Petit
   Vendome does both - it is mobbed during the day by the local office
   workers for a reason.

   Miznon

   If you don't want to stand in line, go next door to Miznon and get
   anything they serve in a pita, along with their incredible cauliflower.

   Ogata

   This stunning Japanese emporium is high on the veritable list of places
   that T Magazine has unwittingly ruined through overexposure. The prices
   have gone up and ability to reserve unless far in advance has gone
   down, but it remains a beautiful restaurant experience nonetheless. If
   you cannot splurge on a meal, have tea at their tea salon or a drink at
   the bar, and buy some tea or a ceramic cup from their carefully curated
   shop.
   Ogata Paris

   Sanjo

   This is my favorite ramen spot, though I usually prefer pork broth to
   chicken. But one of their specialties is Tin Tin ramen that has no
   broth at all. If you go for dinner, their wagyu is to die for.

   Siena

   If an occasion does call for a fancy meal near Vendome, I recommend
   Siena. The room is beautiful and the octopus is magical. Reserve in
   advance on weekdays, as it's a bit of a power lunch spot.

   Soma

   This tiny Japanese izakaya is so good that I almost want to do the
   Parisian thing and not give it away. But my first duty is to you, my
   audience. Pretty much everything I've had on there has always been
   divine.

   Soma Sando

   Soma's sister restaurant is sandwich-driven. Get the first one on the
   menu, pork sando for a melt-in-your-mouth katsu surrounded by delicious
   pickled vegetables and wash it down with a Japanese craft beer from
   Coedo. If you won't love life after this, there is no hope for you.


   BAKERIES

   A Paris guide without a bakery on it is a crime, so here is a short
   list, though undoubtedly I've left many great bakeries off of it.

   Brigat

   This may be my favorite bakery in Paris. Amazing croissants and bread.
   They have a few tables in the back if you need to eat there, or just
   take the food to Places des Vosges - again - and have yourself a baked
   goods picnic.

   D'Isabelle

   Sometimes TikTok is right. Best croissant I've had in Paris. Worth
   standing in line for.

   Mamiche

   Another fantastic bakery owned by two women, Victoria Effantin and
   Cécile Khayat, who source their flour locally. Everything I've tried is
   absolutely delicious. There are a couple of branches.

   Ten Belles

   This is not a typical French bakery with baguettes and croissants. The
   draw here is whole-wheat bread from local flower, and it is absolutely
   delicious. You can still get scones and a very good cup of coffee if
   you are looking for a good breakfast.


   COFFEE

   For the longest time it was hard to get good coffee in Paris, but if
   find yourself in the Williamsburg parts of Paris - roughly, the 3rd,
   the 10th, and the 11th arrondissements, there is now an abundance of
   good coffee spots. Here are a few of them.

   Dreamin' Man

   Best coffee in Paris that for some reason draws an inordinate amount of
   fashion people. It's become much more popular since they opened the
   second outpost at the Broken Arm boutique, but I still prefer the
   rustic feel of the original.

   The Coffee

   All white and vaguely Japanese in inspiration, there are several
   branches, equally good. I could do without the gimmicky ordering
   screens, but it's a small gripe - the coffee is very good.

   Recto Verso

   Another good coffee spot in the Marais, of which there are now many.

   Arabica %

   This growing empire already had one foray into Paris but got into a
   dispute, and the existing coffee shops in the Panoramas gallery and in
   St. Germain had to be rebranded, but it's back now with a pretty shop
   on the border of Marais and the 11th.

   (BUTTON)

   SHOPPING

   In the venerable StyleZeitgeist tradition these shops are arranged more
   or less by walking distance from one another. If you start in the south
   of St. Germain and slowly go north and work your way up across the
   Seine river, you'll be able to hit most of them.

   A Balzac, A Rodin

   Perhaps my favorite rare art and architecture bookstore in Paris, run
   by the loveliest father-and-son duo who are passionate about what they
   do. Digging through its treasure trove is time well-spent. You could
   find something for $400 or for $40, but it will always be good.

   Le Bon Marché

   If you go to one department store in Paris, it should be LBM. The rest
   are lowest common denominator emporiums aimed at tourists (though you
   should go to La Samaritaine to see the incredible building). LBM, on
   the other hand, caters mostly to the local St. Germain audience and its
   assortment shows. Don't miss their book and stationary department and
   their epic food market. Its only drawback, again, is that it's owned by
   LVMH, just like La Samaritaine.

   Hermés

   Next to Le Bon Marché is the most unique and my favorite branch of
   Hermés. It occupies a former swimming pool, which dictates its unusual
   layout. It also has a small cafe, and yes, it will be expensive, but
   served in a Hermés cup and is worth a treat. There is also a small book
   corner. I have not bought books there, but I imagine if you do, you
   still get to walk out with that orange bag.

   Delpire

   This bookshop from the publisher Delpire, who happens to be Sarah
   Moon's husband, is a gem of a space tucked away behind the
   Saint-Germain-des-Prés abbey. A good selection of photo books,
   including those by Moon, and good photo exhibits.

   Librairie 7L

   Karl Lagerfeld's bookstore is also a must. It's very well curated, in
   part because Lagerfeld had a very special relationship with Steidl, one
   of the best photo book publishers in the world. You may notice a smoked
   glass door while you are there; this used to be an entry to Lagerfeld's
   office.

   Dries Van Noten

   The three Dries Van Noten shops- women's, mens, and beauty - are
   adjacent to each on Quai Malaquais, facing the Seine. All are lovely
   jewel boxes that are absolutely worth a visit.

   Rick Owens

   Owens's first boutique is in Palais Royal and is worth a visit for its
   assortment and for that statue that was first of many. It is now twice
   the sizes of the original space, and I still find it charming in its
   own way.

   L'Eclaireur Rue Herold

   If you read StyleZeitgeist, you probably know it already, but if you
   don't, this is the OG spot for the fashion avant-garde. It is one of
   the biggest stockists for Carol Christian Poell, Paul Harnden, and
   Boris Bidjan Saberi, among others.

   Mad et Len

   The StyleZeitgeist universe is incomplete without a Mad et Len black
   iron candle or one of their wonderful perfumes. As a matter of fact one
   of their best-sellers, Asphalt & Rose in a candle, and Apocalypstick in
   perfume, was originally created for our tenth anniversary. Their only
   boutique in the beautiful Gallerie Vivienne is a little world unto its
   own.
   MAD ET LEN BY MATTEO CARCELLI
   (BUTTON)

   Nose

   If you are looking to buy a perfume or a candle in Paris and don't want
   to go to multiple stores, this is your spot, a short walk from Mad et
   Len. An excellent curation of niche perfumery.

   Galerie Yvon Lambert

   I swear it's the last book shop on this list. Listen, be happy that I
   did not put Ofr on it, though you should probably go there too,
   especially if you are looking for magazines.

   Perfumer H

   Lyn Harris's perfumery has become one of my favorites, and its lower
   Marais boutique is a lovely glimpse into her universe.

   SEE

   Paris is a treasure trove of museums and sights. I'm omitting the most
   obvious museums here, such as the Louvre, Musée D'Orsay, and Centre
   George Pompidou, for the obvious reason that you should obviously visit
   them.

   Jardin de Luxembourg

   My favorite park in central Paris, prettier than the plainer and far
   more touristy Jardin Tulieri. Always worth a stroll or a picnic in good
   weather.

   Place des Vosges

   This lovely square in Marais is a hidden gem. Remember what I told you
   about picnicking.

   Museé Galliera

   Paris's fashion museum that does a consistently excellent job curating
   major fashion exhibits.

   Palais de Tokyo / Musee d'art Moderne de Paris

   Across from Galliera are a pair of museums worth visiting, and I really
   should not be lumping them together, but they are literally across from
   each other. The museum of modern art does not need much introduction,
   because it is what it is. Palais de Tokyo is a fun place though, with
   an excellent bookshop, cafe, and restaurant, and is worth spending some
   time in. And you can see the amazing courtyard where Rick Owens stages
   all of his spring/summer shows.

   Foundation Azzedine Alaia

   After Alaia passed away, the building that housed his studio was turned
   into a foundation. It contains a charming exhibition space, a cafe, and
   a bookshop. The clincher is that the foundation kept Alaia's studio
   intact, and you can look into it through a window now, a touching site.
   Foundation Azeddine Alaia
   (BUTTON)

   Atelier Brancusi

   If you go to Pompidou, and even if you don't go to Pompidou, don't miss
   the Constantin Brancusi Studio that sits on the edge of the museum's
   complex. It is a faithful recreation of the atelier complete with many
   statues, instruments, and ephemera. It's never crowded and it has
   become my personal oasis, where you can sit on the bench and meditate
   on Brancusi's modernist masterpieces.

The StyleZeitgeist Guide to Paris: 2025 Edition

   audience. Pretty much everything I've had on there has always been
   divine.

   Soma Sando

   Soma's sister restaurant is sandwich-driven. Get the first one on the
   menu, pork sando for a melt-in-your-mouth katsu surrounded by delicious
   pickled vegetables and wash it down with a Japanese craft beer from
   Coedo. If you won't love life after this, there is no hope for you.


   BAKERIES

   A Paris guide without a bakery on it is a crime, so here is a short
   list, though undoubtedly I've left many great bakeries off of it.

   Brigat

   This may be my favorite bakery in Paris. Amazing croissants and bread.
   They have a few tables in the back if you need to eat there, or just
   take the food to Places des Vosges - again - and have yourself a baked
   goods picnic.

   D'Isabelle

   Sometimes TikTok is right. Best croissant I've had in Paris. Worth
   standing in line for.

   Mamiche

   Another fantastic bakery owned by two women, Victoria Effantin and
   Cécile Khayat, who source their flour locally. Everything I've tried is
   absolutely delicious. There are a couple of branches.

   Ten Belles

   This is not a typical French bakery with baguettes and croissants. The
   draw here is whole-wheat bread from local flower, and it is absolutely
   delicious. You can still get scones and a very good cup of coffee if
   you are looking for a good breakfast.


   COFFEE

   For the longest time it was hard to get good coffee in Paris, but if
   find yourself in the Williamsburg parts of Paris - roughly, the 3rd,
   the 10th, and the 11th arrondissements, there is now an abundance of
   good coffee spots. Here are a few of them.

   Dreamin' Man

   Best coffee in Paris that for some reason draws an inordinate amount of
   fashion people. It's become much more popular since they opened the
   second outpost at the Broken Arm boutique, but I still prefer the
   rustic feel of the original.

   The Coffee

   All white and vaguely Japanese in inspiration, there are several
   branches, equally good. I could do without the gimmicky ordering
   screens, but it's a small gripe - the coffee is very good.

   Recto Verso

   Another good coffee spot in the Marais, of which there are now many.

   Arabica %

   This growing empire already had one foray into Paris but got into a
   dispute, and the existing coffee shops in the Panoramas gallery and in
   St. Germain had to be rebranded, but it's back now with a pretty shop
   on the border of Marais and the 11th.

          RICK OWENS SHOP, COURTESY OF OWENS CORP

   SHOPPING

   In the venerable StyleZeitgeist tradition these shops are arranged more
   or less by walking distance from one another. If you start in the south
   of St. Germain and slowly go north and work your way up across the
   Seine river, you'll be able to hit most of them.

   A Balzac, A Rodin

   Perhaps my favorite rare art and architecture bookstore in Paris, run
   by the loveliest father-and-son duo who are passionate about what they
   do. Digging through its treasure trove is time well-spent. You could
   find something for $400 or for $40, but it will always be good.

   Le Bon Marché

   If you go to one department store in Paris, it should be LBM. The rest
   are lowest common denominator emporiums aimed at tourists (though you
   should go to La Samaritaine to see the incredible building). LBM, on
   the other hand, caters mostly to the local St. Germain audience and its
   assortment shows. Don't miss their book and stationary department and
   their epic food market. Its only drawback, again, is that it's owned by
   LVMH, just like La Samaritaine.

   Hermés

   Next to Le Bon Marché is the most unique and my favorite branch of
   Hermés. It occupies a former swimming pool, which dictates its unusual
   layout. It also has a small cafe, and yes, it will be expensive, but
   served in a Hermés cup and is worth a treat. There is also a small book
   corner. I have not bought books there, but I imagine if you do, you
   still get to walk out with that orange bag.

   Delpire

   This bookshop from the publisher Delpire, who happens to be Sarah
   Moon's husband, is a gem of a space tucked away behind the
   Saint-Germain-des-Prés abbey. A good selection of photo books,
   including those by Moon, and good photo exhibits.

   Librairie 7L

   Karl Lagerfeld's bookstore is also a must. It's very well curated, in
   part because Lagerfeld had a very special relationship with Steidl, one
   of the best photo book publishers in the world. You may notice a smoked
   glass door while you are there; this used to be an entry to Lagerfeld's
   office.

   Dries Van Noten

   The three Dries Van Noten shops- women's, mens, and beauty - are
   adjacent to each on Quai Malaquais, facing the Seine. All are lovely
   jewel boxes that are absolutely worth a visit.

   Rick Owens

   Owens's first boutique is in Palais Royal and is worth a visit for its
   assortment and for that statue that was first of many. It is now twice
   the sizes of the original space, and I still find it charming in its
   own way.

   L'Eclaireur Rue Herold

   If you read StyleZeitgeist, you probably know it already, but if you
   don't, this is the OG spot for the fashion avant-garde. It is one of
   the biggest stockists for Carol Christian Poell, Paul Harnden, and
   Boris Bidjan Saberi, among others.

   Mad et Len

   The StyleZeitgeist universe is incomplete without a Mad et Len black
   iron candle or one of their wonderful perfumes. As a matter of fact one
   of their best-sellers, Asphalt & Rose in a candle, and Apocalypstick in
   perfume, was originally created for our tenth anniversary. Their only
   boutique in the beautiful Gallerie Vivienne is a little world unto its
   own.

          MAD ET LEN BY MATTEO CARCELLI

   Nose

   If you are looking to buy a perfume or a candle in Paris and don't want
   to go to multiple stores, this is your spot, a short walk from Mad et
   Len. An excellent curation of niche perfumery.

   Galerie Yvon Lambert

   I swear it's the last book shop on this list. Listen, be happy that I
   did not put Ofr on it, though you should probably go there too,
   especially if you are looking for magazines.

   Perfumer H

   Lyn Harris's perfumery has become one of my favorites, and its lower
   Marais boutique is a lovely glimpse into her universe.

   SEE

   Paris is a treasure trove of museums and sights. I'm omitting the most
   obvious museums here, such as the Louvre, Musée D'Orsay, and Centre
   George Pompidou, for the obvious reason that you should obviously visit
   them.

   Jardin de Luxembourg

   My favorite park in central Paris, prettier than the plainer and far
   more touristy Jardin Tulieri. Always worth a stroll or a picnic in good
   weather.

   Place des Vosges

   This lovely square in Marais is a hidden gem. Remember what I told you
   about picnicking.

   Museé Galliera

   Paris's fashion museum that does a consistently excellent job curating
   major fashion exhibits.

   Palais de Tokyo / Musee d'art Moderne de Paris

   Across from Galliera are a pair of museums worth visiting, and I really
   should not be lumping them together, but they are literally across from
   each other. The museum of modern art does not need much introduction,
   because it is what it is. Palais de Tokyo is a fun place though, with
   an excellent bookshop, cafe, and restaurant, and is worth spending some
   time in. And you can see the amazing courtyard where Rick Owens stages
   all of his spring/summer shows.

   Foundation Azzedine Alaia

   After Alaia passed away, the building that housed his studio was turned
   into a foundation. It contains a charming exhibition space, a cafe, and
   a bookshop. The clincher is that the foundation kept Alaia's studio
   intact, and you can look into it through a window now, a touching site.

          Foundation Azeddine Alaia

   Atelier Brancusi

   If you go to Pompidou, and even if you don't go to Pompidou, don't miss
   the Constantin Brancusi Studio that sits on the edge of the museum's
   complex. It is a faithful recreation of the atelier complete with many
   statues, instruments, and ephemera. It's never crowded and it has
   become my personal oasis, where you can sit on the bench and meditate
   on Brancusi's modernist masterpieces.

Superfine: Tailoring Black Style at the Met Museum in New York

   FashionBy Karlo SteelMay 9, 2025

   Superfine, an exhibition on Black dandyism which opens this Saturday at
   The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, presents a history of Black
   style through the lense of dandyism, emphasizing the importance of
   sartorial style to Black identity formation in the Atlantic diaspora
   and the ways Black designers have interpreted and reimaged this
   history. The exhibition aims to highlight the various styles one could
   employ in order to be identified as a dandy: from austere minimalism to
   hyper-colorful tailoring, from deconstructed denim to high tech
   sportswear, dispelling the stereotype of flamboyance being the only
   indicator of dandyism.

   you separate the art from the artist? - and dive into other aspects of
   Lagerfeld's life and work.

   One of the several questions that came to me as I was leaving the press

   Or, to reframe it in broader context, what is the role of museums
   today?

   It aims to challenge the notion, usually found in the popular

   "We are not a fashion company," said Satoshi Kuwata, the designer of
   SETCHU, emphatically, after showing a foldable origami blazer he
   developed with Davies & Son, the oldest Saville Row tailor. We were at
   the press preview for his show at Pitti Uomo, the premier men's trade
   show in Florence. It was the first SETCHU show, and, according to
   Kuwata, most likely its last; the reason being that Kuwata's clothes

The StyleZeitgeist Guide to Paris: 2025 Edition

   Features/Op-Ed, TravelBy Eugene RabkinFeb 13, 2025

   On some level writing a guide to Paris is an exercise in futility. What
   can one write about a city where you can get a good glass of wine and a
   decent meal in so many places - as long as you stay away from the
   touristy areas - and where there is no such thing as the best bakery,
   since you can only get bread that is either fine or excellent.
   Therefore, this guide to Paris is the guide to what I have gotten to
   know over the years of traveling to the City of Light.

   I've been to Paris about fifty times, I've walked it back and forth,
   and I know I am not nearly close to discovering all the good things it
   has to offer and have not sufficiently explored all of its
   neighborhoods (for example, I rarely find myself in Montmartre, or in
   Charonne, and some day I'd like to eat my way through rue des Martyrs).
   I've not been to the 20th arrondissement, which is where the epicenter
   of hipsterdom has moved to. I have not yet been to the Catacombs (very
   ungoth of me), and I've never had any luck record shopping in Paris. So
   this guide is flawed and deeply personal, and I am all ears if you want
   to add to it.

Superfine: Tailoring Black Style at the Met Museum in New York

   FashionBy Karlo SteelMay 9, 2025

   Superfine, an exhibition on Black dandyism which opens this Saturday at
   The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, presents a history of Black
   style through the lense of dandyism, emphasizing the importance of
   sartorial style to Black identity formation in the Atlantic diaspora
   and the ways Black designers have interpreted and reimaged this
   history. The exhibition aims to highlight the various styles one could
   employ in order to be identified as a dandy: from austere minimalism to
   hyper-colorful tailoring, from deconstructed denim to high tech
   sportswear, dispelling the stereotype of flamboyance being the only
   indicator of dandyism.

OUTLAWS: Fashion Renegades Of Leigh Bowery's 1980s London

   FashionBy Karlo SteelApr 23, 2025

   That burst of angry, youthful energy unleashed on London streets in
   1976 called punk indelibly changed the trajectory of nightclubbing
   forever. For about eighteen months, sartorial individuality reigned for
   those initial participants. Although Westwood and McLaren's SEX and
   Seditionaires boutique provided expensive garments infused with the
   spikily subversiveness forever associated with punk, DIY styling rose
   like a rocket within those months with a slew of customization ideas
   utilized to express disaffection, nihilism and sexual deviation.

What Happened to Youth Culture?

   something worthwhile, namely, what's happening to today's youth,
   specifically in the cultural space, and even more specifically as it

The StyleZeitgeist Guide to Antwerp : 2025 Edition

   Features/Op-Ed, TravelBy Eugene RabkinFeb 20, 2025Leave a comment

   It is hard to believe that we have not updated our Antwerp guide since
   2013, what with it being one of my favorite cities in Europe. What
   keeps pulling me back to this city, besides professional obligations?
   Fashion, obviously, as well as a mix of medieval and contemporary
   architecture, with some Art Nouveau buildings thrown...

EXPO JAN-JAN VAN ESSCHE - MOMU ANTWERP

   FashionBy EditorsFeb 14, 2025

   "Khayal" is an intimate exhibit of the Antwerp designer Jan-Jan Van
   Essche, currently on display at MoMu, the city's fashion museum. The
   installation takes over the ground floor space of the museum. It begins
   with Van Essche's calligraphy-based drawings that guide you into just
   one room, where the designer has created an installation highlighting
   ten key silhouettes that embody his work. The space unfolds gradually
   as you walk around a wooden construction resembling traditional
   Japanese architecture, with custom made mannequins that reflect the
   designer's earthy West-meets-East approach. The serenity of the space
   gradually takes over, reflecting the serenity of Van Essche's designs
   as reflected in the handmade natural fabrics, indigo dyes, and loose
   silhouettes. Van Essche has created his own world, conducive to
   contemplation and slowing down time, and by the end of your visit the
   world outside will fall away.

She Walks in Beauty: Olivier Theyskens

   Culture, FashionBy Eugene RabkinNov 30, 2017

   If you find yourself in Antwerp in the coming months, or need a reason
   to go there, a visit to the "Olivier Theyskens: She Walks in Beauty"
   exhibit at the ModeMuseum (MoMu) will take you back to the time when
   fashion with capital "F" was still important, when that fickle
   enterprise still had sweep and grandeur, before the paralyzing effect
   of irony and false self-deprecation that accounts for much of fashion's
   blandness today had set in. It was a time when couture was made
   thoroughly modern by the likes of Alexander McQueen, John Galliano, and
   Martin Margiela, those designers who still bothered to learn the
   fashion playbook before tearing it to shreds, sometimes literally.

Shop:Case - Ann Demeulemeester Flagship in Antwerp

   Fashion, RetailBy Eugene RabkinNov 9, 2017

   It was with great trepidation that I first walked into the Ann
   Demeulemeester flagship store in Antwerp in 2001. It was on my first
   trip to Europe. I was twenty-five, and I was backpacking, reclaiming my
   American right of passage, about seven years too late, but I had no
   money before that. It's safe to say that I was probably the only
   backpacker this summer to stop over in Antwerp to go shopping for
   fashion. But it was the highlight of my trip. I stuffed my backpack
   into a locker at the magnificent Antwerp train station, and made a
   beeline for Louis, followed by Dries Van Noten, and then a long walk
   down Nationalstraat to Ann Demeulemeester, saving the best for last. I
   don't remember why, but I only bought a belt there, which I still wear.
   "Just the belt?" the salesperson ask, probably not meaning to embarrass
   me.

Dries Van Noten at MoMu

   Culture, FashionBy Eugene RabkinMar 12, 2015

   Two weeks ago I got to see the Dries Van Noten: Inspirations exhibit at
   MoMu, Antwerp's fashion museum. As the title suggests, the exhibit
   provides a glimpse into Van Noten's world, and the influences that feed
   the wellspring of his creativity.

   I have already seen the initial version of the exhibit at the Musee des
   Arts Decoratifs in Paris. It was received with typical fanfare that the
   fashion press is all too ready to dispense. But while I liked it
   overall, I was so exhausted by the two floors of continuous explosion
   of color and ornament that I was happy to get some fresh Parisian air
   when I finally got out.

AT PITTI UOMO SETCHU ASKS MORE OF US BY ASKING LESS

   Fashion, Features/Op-EdBy Eugene RabkinJan 17, 2025

   "We are not a fashion company," said Satoshi Kuwata, the designer of
   SETCHU, emphatically, after showing a foldable origami blazer he
   developed with Davies & Son, the oldest Saville Row tailor. We were at
   the press preview for his show at Pitti Uomo, the premier men's trade
   show in Florence. It was the first SETCHU show, and, according to
   Kuwata, most likely its last; the reason being that Kuwata's clothes
   require careful examination, not to say contemplation.

OUTLAWS: Fashion Renegades Of Leigh Bowery's 1980s London

   FashionBy Karlo SteelApr 23, 2025

   That burst of angry, youthful energy unleashed on London streets in
   1976 called punk indelibly changed the trajectory of nightclubbing
   forever. For about eighteen months, sartorial individuality reigned for
   those initial participants. Although Westwood and McLaren's SEX and
   Seditionaires boutique provided expensive garments infused with the
   spikily subversiveness forever associated with punk, DIY styling rose
   like a rocket within those months with a slew of customization ideas
   utilized to express disaffection, nihilism and sexual deviation.

The StyleZeitgeist Guide to Antwerp : 2025 Edition

   Features/Op-Ed, TravelBy Eugene RabkinFeb 20, 2025Leave a comment

   It is hard to believe that we have not updated our Antwerp guide since
   2013, what with it being one of my favorite cities in Europe. What
   keeps pulling me back to this city, besides professional obligations?
   Fashion, obviously, as well as a mix of medieval and contemporary
   architecture, with some Art Nouveau buildings thrown...

The StyleZeitgeist Guide to Paris: 2025 Edition

   Features/Op-Ed, TravelBy Eugene RabkinFeb 13, 2025

   On some level writing a guide to Paris is an exercise in futility. What
   can one write about a city where you can get a good glass of wine and a
   decent meal in so many places - as long as you stay away from the
   touristy areas - and where there is no such thing as the best bakery,
   since you can only get bread that is either fine or excellent.
   Therefore, this guide to Paris is the guide to what I have gotten to
   know over the years of traveling to the City of Light.

   I've been to Paris about fifty times, I've walked it back and forth,
   and I know I am not nearly close to discovering all the good things it
   has to offer and have not sufficiently explored all of its
   neighborhoods (for example, I rarely find myself in Montmartre, or in
   Charonne, and some day I'd like to eat my way through rue des Martyrs).
   I've not been to the 20th arrondissement, which is where the epicenter
   of hipsterdom has moved to. I have not yet been to the Catacombs (very
   ungoth of me), and I've never had any luck record shopping in Paris. So
   this guide is flawed and deeply personal, and I am all ears if you want
   to add to it.

Superfine: Tailoring Black Style at the Met Museum in New York

   Photo © The Metropolitan Museum of Art
   (BUTTON)

   Superfine, an exhibition on Black dandyism which opens this Saturday at
   The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, presents a history of Black
   style through the lense of dandyism, emphasizing the importance of
   sartorial style to Black identity formation in the Atlantic diaspora
   and the ways Black designers have interpreted and reimaged this
   history. The exhibition aims to highlight the various styles one could
   employ in order to be identified as a dandy: from austere minimalism to
   hyper-colorful tailoring, from deconstructed denim to high tech
   sportswear, dispelling the stereotype of flamboyance being the only
   indicator of dandyism.

   The Met does a remarkable job with the historical legacy of dandyism by
   including artifacts from the giants of the African diaspora, like
   Frederick Douglass' tailcoat, a photograph of an immaculately dressed
   W.E.B DuBois at the 1900 Paris International Exposition, and paintings
   of Toussaint Louverture, the Haitian revolutionary responsible for
   establishing the foundation for the first democratic republic in the
   Americas, as well as lesser known designers like Jeffrey Banks and
   Morty Sills, whose dedication to tailoring was responsible for the
   GQ-like suaveness of menswear in the 1970s and 1980s.

   (BUTTON)

   However, at just thirty five, the selection of contemporary Black
   designers' work representative of dandyism within the exhibition is
   small, a mere fraction of the hundreds of fashion houses populating
   America and Europe. Some designers, like Pyer Moss, are no longer in
   operation. Others, like Balmain, Wales Bonner, Bianca Saunders and
   3.Paradis were allotted four looks each. Louis Vuitton, the show's main
   sponsor, had five, not including the various accessories owned by Andre
   Leon Talley, the Black dandy par excellence. Some of the outfits
   presented could only be considered dandy if you squinted, their style
   too quotidian without a body to animate it. A few were clearly not of
   the highest quality; flimsy wools and visible seams made a regrettable
   impression given the show is meant to highlight the extraordinary
   stylistic expressions of Blackness.

   While The Met's Costume Institute may have had good intentions by
   underscore the undeniable influence Black dandyism has had on style and
   fashion, it unintentionally revealed the dearth of Black designers at
   the helm of fashion houses today, giving one pause to consider why that
   is the case.

   Upon entering the exhibit, one is greeted with a deconstructed
   greatcoat by John Galliano for Dior worn by Talley. It is a spectacular
   example of both high craftsmanship and high design, showing what can be
   achieved when creativity has the backing of a monied house. There were
   other examples scattered throughout the show: the paired back luxe of
   Maximillian Davis at Ferragamo, the unapologetic glam of Olivier
   Rousteing at Balmain, the flamboyant tuxedo of outsized proportions by
   Ib Kamara at Louis Vuitton, which he dedicated to the memory of Virgil
   Abloh, who died before his last collection was finished, and the
   striking anatomical overstitching on tailored jackets by Kamara at Off
   White. Kamara is one of the most in-demand stylists and was a close
   collaborator of Abloh, which explains both of these credits, and his
   presence at the exhibit confirms his remarkably swift ascent within the
   fashion industry as a formidably talented image-maker.

   Pop culture, on which Black artists have exercised outsize influence,
   also gets short shrift. There is one frilly blouse from Prince, a dandy
   personified, an angular, sequined jacket worn by disco queen Sylvester,
   and a tailcoat designed by Jean Paul Gaultier worn by Grace Jones in
   2012 (the Armani jacket she wore on the iconic cover of her 1981 album
   Nightclubbing was not on view). There was nothing from the
   magnificently pompadoured Little Richard, the man who practically
   invented rock and roll, no velvet plushness or antique military jackets
   from guitar hero Jimi Hendrix, none of the foxy fabulousness of Sly
   Stone's black leather and studs jumpsuits, or the wiggy expressions of
   Andre 3000, or the nerdy chic of Tyler The Creator.

   The Harlem Renaissance, arguably the apex of Black dandyism, was given
   fractured attention throughout the show. The era's convergence of
   music, art, literature, photography and queer culture produced a
   flowering of stylistic inventions recognized globally both now and
   then. Highlighting the importance of that cultural watershed, its
   reverberations and artifacts still very much with us, could have served
   as touchstone to the exhibition's theme, an easy entry point to those
   unaware of its significance or to Black dandyism.

   Somewhat inexplicably, the show closed with looks by Latino designers
   Willy Chavarria and Luar. It is unclear as to why they were included in
   a show on Black dandyism, as both have stated that their work is
   inspired by various Latino communities. Yes, there were non-Black
   designers included in the show (like the aforementioned Galliano) but
   they were included within a context of Blackness. Chavarria and Luar's
   inclusion underscores how Blackness is often viewed as porous and
   non-exclusive. It made for a questionable closing.

   Before exiting through the gift shop, I turned around to admire the
   impressively dynamic set design by Torkwase Dyson, undoubtedly one of
   the most accomplished artists working today. Her arresting,
   architectural forms: geometric, monolithic, and monochrome, were
   illuminated to dazzling effect by cold white lighting (certain
   perspectives in the show gave the impression of being in a German
   Expressionist film). Dyson, who says her `hyper shapes come out of a
   study on the period of Black folks coming out of slavery," was an
   excellent choice to imbue Superfine with an unflinching modernity
   synonymous with the Black dandy who rises, phoenix like,

   in all of their splendor, as the beacon of beauty in times of
   instability and uncertainty. I only wished there was more fashion on
   par with Dyson's vision.

   magnificently pompadoured Little Richard, the man who practically
   invented rock and roll, no velvet plushness or antique military jackets
   from guitar hero Jimi Hendrix, none of the foxy fabulousness of Sly
   Stone's black leather and studs jumpsuits, or the wiggy expressions of
   Andre 3000, or the nerdy chic of Tyler The Creator.

          Twentieth - Century Photography Fund, 2015 (2015.330).

   The Harlem Renaissance, arguably the apex of Black dandyism, was given
   fractured attention throughout the show. The era's convergence of
   music, art, literature, photography and queer culture produced a
   flowering of stylistic inventions recognized globally both now and
   then. Highlighting the importance of that cultural watershed, its
   reverberations and artifacts still very much with us, could have served
   as touchstone to the exhibition's theme, an easy entry point to those
   unaware of its significance or to Black dandyism.

   Somewhat inexplicably, the show closed with looks by Latino designers
   Willy Chavarria and Luar. It is unclear as to why they were included in
   a show on Black dandyism, as both have stated that their work is
   inspired by various Latino communities. Yes, there were non-Black
   designers included in the show (like the aforementioned Galliano) but
   they were included within a context of Blackness. Chavarria and Luar's
   inclusion underscores how Blackness is often viewed as porous and
   non-exclusive. It made for a questionable closing.

   Before exiting through the gift shop, I turned around to admire the
   impressively dynamic set design by Torkwase Dyson, undoubtedly one of
   the most accomplished artists working today. Her arresting,
   architectural forms: geometric, monolithic, and monochrome, were
   illuminated to dazzling effect by cold white lighting (certain
   perspectives in the show gave the impression of being in a German
   Expressionist film). Dyson, who says her `hyper shapes come out of a
   study on the period of Black folks coming out of slavery," was an
   excellent choice to imbue Superfine with an unflinching modernity
   synonymous with the Black dandy who rises, phoenix like,

   in all of their splendor, as the beacon of beauty in times of
   instability and uncertainty. I only wished there was more fashion on
   par with Dyson's vision.

OUTLAWS: Fashion Renegades Of Leigh Bowery's 1980s London

   That burst of angry, youthful energy unleashed on London streets in
   1976 called punk indelibly changed the trajectory of nightclubbing
   forever. For about eighteen months, sartorial individuality reigned for
   those initial participants. Although Westwood and McLaren's SEX and
   Seditionaries boutique provided expensive garments infused with the
   spikily subversiveness forever associated with punk, DIY styling rose
   like a rocket within those months with a slew of customization ideas
   utilized to express disaffection, nihilism and sexual deviation.

   But it would not last. Punk quickly became a uniform (black leather
   jacket, choppy hair, etc.) and the promise of a fabulously
   individualistic future faded by 1978. One of the disappointed, the
   illustratively named Steve Strange, and his friend DJ Rusty Egan,
   decided to do something about it by starting a "Bowie Night", every
   Tuesday, at a tiny club in seedy Soho called Billy's in the autumn of
   that year.

   Billy's brought back the individuality craved by its denizens. The
   scene grew and moved to Blitz wine bar in Covent Garden after a year,
   becoming an incubator for the creative movers and shakers who would
   shape the following decade. The sartorial one upmanship reached
   stratospheric heights when hundred year old costumier Charles Fox
   closed its doors in 1980, selling off its stock for pennies on the
   pound. The press became enthralled by the peacockery, dubbing them the
   New Romantics, a title they hated. But the die had been cast and the
   club kid was born.

   Leigh Bowery got wind of nocturnal London's colorful characters and
   decided to up sticks to the English capital from Sunshine, Australia in
   1980. i-D, The Face and Blitz were all born that same year, putting the
   party participants on their covers. It would be seven years before
   Bowery would land the cover of i-D, but he would grace their pages as
   early as 1983.

   Martin Green and NJ Stevenson's Outlaws: Fashion Renegades of Leigh
   Bowery's

   1980s London captures the exciting London club scene. It is a touching
   photographic catalogue showcasing the unbridled creative spirit and
   wiggy, wayward glamour of that era. It also resurrects the names of a
   few forgotten but undeniably talented creators like John Flett, who
   invented a new bias cutting technique which infused his garments with a
   liquid languidness, and Elmaz Hüseyin, who created the clothing for pop
   group ABC when they reinvented themselves as clubtastic cartoons in
   1984. The book closes with "The Afterparty", a profile of some of the
   original participants, their sartorial innovativeness intact after
   decades, a touching way to honor the people who made the styles, and
   the party, happen.

   Although the flounces and bows associated with the New Romantic look
   all but disappeared by the end of 1981, extreme sartorial expressions
   did not. Cha Cha, which opened in `81 in the back of Heaven, Europe's
   largest gay disco, was hosted by angular Blitz habutée Scarlett Cannon
   and future stylist extraordinaire Judy Blame. Cha Cha would be Bowery's
   entré into café society, confirming his desire for outlandish
   presentation. Philip Sallon, whose flamboyant appearance pre-dated
   punk, hosted the wildly successful Mud Club in 1983, providing a more
   legitimate space for the exotically clad. That same year, Bowery began
   to make waves on the nightclub scene as a blue faced spectacle in
   stripy tights and ass revealing jacket.

   Bowery launched his own club night, Taboo, in 1985. Initially sluggish,
   it exploded after a few months, becoming the hottest and most difficult
   club to gain access to if you were not dressed to the nines. Its run
   was brief, about a year, brought down by drug use and deaths. But at
   its peak, it was the most colorful playground of stylistic expression
   London had ever seen. And what did they wear? Perhaps a jacket trimmed
   in bobby pins or a pair of frilly underwear as designed by Bowery
   himself? Or maybe John Crancher's white maxi coat with bondage straps
   or Bodymap's stretchy, stripy jerseys. Dean Bright's sumptuously velvet
   creations as worn by singer Pete Burns of Dead Or Alive in their video
   for "You Spin Me Round" might have gotten you past Marc Vaultier,
   Taboo's notorious doorman. It could have been one of Pam Hogg's color
   blocked, body skimming catsuits designed to make one look like a
   futuristic Emma Peel. Maybe a Christopher Nemeth jacket upcycled from
   old mail sacks, topped off with one of Judy Blame's berets festooned
   with buttons and ribbons. A John Galliano jacket from his Ludic Game
   collection, abbreviated to barely there proportions? Stephen Linard's
   biker jacket in orange and black faux tiger fur would have looked good
   on the amyl scented dancefloor. One of Richard Torry's ingeniously
   laddered knitwear pieces would have surely done the trick. Whatever it
   was, it has found a commemorative document in Outlaws.
