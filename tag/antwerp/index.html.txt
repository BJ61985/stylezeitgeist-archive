The StyleZeitgeist Guide to Antwerp : 2025 Edition

   Features/Op-Ed, TravelBy Eugene RabkinFeb 20, 2025Leave a comment

   It is hard to believe that we have not updated our Antwerp guide since
   2013, what with it being one of my favorite cities in Europe. What
   keeps pulling me back to this city, besides professional obligations?
   Fashion, obviously, as well as a mix of medieval and contemporary
   architecture, with some Art Nouveau buildings thrown...

EXPO JAN-JAN VAN ESSCHE - MOMU ANTWERP

   FashionBy EditorsFeb 14, 2025

   "Khayal" is an intimate exhibit of the Antwerp designer Jan-Jan Van
   Essche, currently on display at MoMu, the city's fashion museum. The
   installation takes over the ground floor space of the museum. It begins
   with Van Essche's calligraphy-based drawings that guide you into just
   one room, where the designer has created an installation highlighting
   ten key silhouettes that embody his work. The space unfolds gradually
   as you walk around a wooden construction resembling traditional
   Japanese architecture, with custom made mannequins that reflect the
   designer's earthy West-meets-East approach. The serenity of the space
   gradually takes over, reflecting the serenity of Van Essche's designs
   as reflected in the handmade natural fabrics, indigo dyes, and loose
   silhouettes. Van Essche has created his own world, conducive to
   contemplation and slowing down time, and by the end of your visit the
   world outside will fall away.

She Walks in Beauty: Olivier Theyskens

   Culture, FashionBy Eugene RabkinNov 30, 2017

   If you find yourself in Antwerp in the coming months, or need a reason
   to go there, a visit to the "Olivier Theyskens: She Walks in Beauty"
   exhibit at the ModeMuseum (MoMu) will take you back to the time when
   fashion with capital "F" was still important, when that fickle
   enterprise still had sweep and grandeur, before the paralyzing effect
   of irony and false self-deprecation that accounts for much of fashion's
   blandness today had set in. It was a time when couture was made
   thoroughly modern by the likes of Alexander McQueen, John Galliano, and
   Martin Margiela, those designers who still bothered to learn the
   fashion playbook before tearing it to shreds, sometimes literally.

Shop:Case - Ann Demeulemeester Flagship in Antwerp

   Fashion, RetailBy Eugene RabkinNov 9, 2017

   It was with great trepidation that I first walked into the Ann
   Demeulemeester flagship store in Antwerp in 2001. It was on my first
   trip to Europe. I was twenty-five, and I was backpacking, reclaiming my
   American right of passage, about seven years too late, but I had no
   money before that. It's safe to say that I was probably the only
   backpacker this summer to stop over in Antwerp to go shopping for
   fashion. But it was the highlight of my trip. I stuffed my backpack
   into a locker at the magnificent Antwerp train station, and made a
   beeline for Louis, followed by Dries Van Noten, and then a long walk
   down Nationalstraat to Ann Demeulemeester, saving the best for last. I
   don't remember why, but I only bought a belt there, which I still wear.
   "Just the belt?" the salesperson ask, probably not meaning to embarrass
   me.

   It's day three of the StyleZeitgeist book week, where we review the

Dries Van Noten at MoMu

   Culture, FashionBy Eugene RabkinMar 12, 2015

   Two weeks ago I got to see the Dries Van Noten: Inspirations exhibit at
   MoMu, Antwerp's fashion museum. As the title suggests, the exhibit
   provides a glimpse into Van Noten's world, and the influences that feed
   the wellspring of his creativity.

   I have already seen the initial version of the exhibit at the Musee des
   Arts Decoratifs in Paris. It was received with typical fanfare that the
   fashion press is all too ready to dispense. But while I liked it
   overall, I was so exhausted by the two floors of continuous explosion
   of color and ornament that I was happy to get some fresh Parisian air
   when I finally got out.
