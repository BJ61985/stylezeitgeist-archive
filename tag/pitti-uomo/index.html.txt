AT PITTI UOMO SETCHU ASKS MORE OF US BY ASKING LESS

   Fashion, Features/Op-EdBy Eugene RabkinJan 17, 2025

   show in Florence. It was the first SETCHU show, and, according to
   Kuwata, most likely its last; the reason being that Kuwata's clothes
   require careful examination, not to say contemplation.

At Pitti Uomo Sterling Ruby Proves That Ideas Still Matter

   Fashion, Features/Op-EdBy Eugene RabkinJun 14, 2019
