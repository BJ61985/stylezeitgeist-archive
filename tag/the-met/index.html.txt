Superfine: Tailoring Black Style at the Met Museum in New York

   FashionBy Karlo SteelMay 9, 2025

   Superfine, an exhibition on Black dandyism which opens this Saturday at
   The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, presents a history of Black
   style through the lense of dandyism, emphasizing the importance of
   sartorial style to Black identity formation in the Atlantic diaspora
   and the ways Black designers have interpreted and reimaged this
   history. The exhibition aims to highlight the various styles one could

   hyper-colorful tailoring, from deconstructed denim to high tech
   sportswear, dispelling the stereotype of flamboyance being the only
   indicator of dandyism.

   FashionBy Eugene RabkinMay 3, 2017

   If you go to the Met Museum's Comme des Garçons show, do not leave
   without buying the accompanying catalog. If you don't go to the show,

Comme des Garçons at the Met

   Events, FashionBy Eugene RabkinMay 2, 2017

   One of the several questions that came to me as I was leaving the press
   preview of the "Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Garçons: Art of the In-Between"
   show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art was, "Who is this exhibit for?"

   imagination, that handwork and machine work somehow exist in the state
   of opposition.
