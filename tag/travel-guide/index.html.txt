The StyleZeitgeist Guide to Antwerp : 2025 Edition

   Features/Op-Ed, TravelBy Eugene RabkinFeb 20, 2025Leave a comment

   It is hard to believe that we have not updated our Antwerp guide since
   2013, what with it being one of my favorite cities in Europe. What
   keeps pulling me back to this city, besides professional obligations?
   Fashion, obviously, as well as a mix of medieval and contemporary

The StyleZeitgeist Guide to Paris: 2025 Edition

   Features/Op-Ed, TravelBy Eugene RabkinFeb 13, 2025

   On some level writing a guide to Paris is an exercise in futility. What
   can one write about a city where you can get a good glass of wine and a
   decent meal in so many places - as long as you stay away from the
   touristy areas - and where there is no such thing as the best bakery,
   since you can only get bread that is either fine or excellent.
   Therefore, this guide to Paris is the guide to what I have gotten to
   know over the years of traveling to the City of Light.

   I've been to Paris about fifty times, I've walked it back and forth,
   and I know I am not nearly close to discovering all the good things it
   has to offer and have not sufficiently explored all of its
   neighborhoods (for example, I rarely find myself in Montmartre, or in
   Charonne, and some day I'd like to eat my way through rue des Martyrs).
   I've not been to the 20th arrondissement, which is where the epicenter
   of hipsterdom has moved to. I have not yet been to the Catacombs (very
   ungoth of me), and I've never had any luck record shopping in Paris. So
   this guide is flawed and deeply personal, and I am all ears if you want
   to add to it.
